It's inevitable that someone will clone a site and compete with an owner, so obfuscating is one solution, but it takes time and skill. One's best defense is to have an active community who is loyal to the zite creator. If you think someone outright \"stole\" a site, then don't use it and don't host it. Conflicts will occur, but don't be nasty or we'll have..

This is all volunteer for us on an experimental platform. Time is always a factor with expenses and such. But it's good that we developers explain ourselves for non-developers, because there's sometimes the impression that we should be more diligent in how we make our apps, especially in the areas of design and attribution. There's quite high expectations that apps will be complete, polished, bug-tested, more in line with commercial software. It's not really like that here. A good layout with an 'about' page, some instructions, and friendly UI customization can take days or weeks. I'm only just at the stage of cannibalizing my previous apps as a time saving measure.

Our best hope is to develop our own coin for very niche markets such as ZN where there are currently no other options for transactions between direct peers.\n\nThe cryptography and learning involved is beyond the scope of many coders so there's also the chance to shine on someone's radar which might hook into an online job here and there doing designer blockchains for bitcoin or cash. It's still an exciting field with huge potential, and here in ZTalk we can read about the many success stories in the P2P topic. The trick is to move away from Proof of Work which wastes power to another type of proof which has profit incentive built in. In the case of solar it's about running blockchains to manage the micro-grid generation in a distributed way. In the case of ZN we already have a growing pool of users who are in the habit of leaving some machine on hosting zites, so if we can biggy-back off that and help pay people's power at the same time then it's win-win and more people will join.\n\nI've got an example miner working as ZN plugin, so just now trying to hook it up with frontend and sqlite. Should have something running soon.",

We're running a P2P network here which technically is doing the same thing so it would still be work, but have a positive outcome.. ie. the support and hosting of ZN zites.. so i'd call it Proof of (hosting, peering, popularity, bounty, etc) or a combination of those if possible.",

That's how Bitcoin started, but the centralization of mining is a huge issue which has not been addressed even as the block rewards have fallen to 12.5 BTC. (~$7,500) Many alt-coins are evolving quickly to solve the problem, so i expect we'll see some challengers to Bitcoin's lead sooner or later.",
