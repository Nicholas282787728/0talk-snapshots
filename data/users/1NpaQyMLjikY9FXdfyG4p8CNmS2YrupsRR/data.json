I'm sure we all appreciate the efforts of the curator, but it's not a native torrenting site. ZeroNet needs a Kickass Torrents clone or at least something with a decent UI. PLAY is a good start.\n\n?\n\nHave you looked at ZeroTorrents? It's literally a torrent website for everything. ZeroPlay is also extremely good for movies, just finished watching a 720p quality version of The Angry Birds movie off of it. There are comment sections on torrents, all we need is a rating system on them and we're set to be like kickasstorrents.",
