To maintain anonymity, it might be best if it was opt-in only, since some people might not want their sites indexed.\n\n0list is messy to browse, and ZeroName is searchable if you ctrl+F through the mess, but there's no descriptions and a good portion of the names seem to be dead links. But just for exploration, it seems more difficult than it needs to be.",
