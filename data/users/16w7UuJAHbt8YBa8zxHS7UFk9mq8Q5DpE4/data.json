Might have to test this on a dummy site, but some input on the matter would be much appreciated.

			"body": "http://lifehacker.com/5990525/why-i-stopped-pirating-and-started-paying-for-media\n&nbsp;\nVery good article from Lifehacker.com\n&nbsp;\nSurprisingly enough, he didn't do it because he felt some kind of moral obligation to do so - _he did it because he felt it was cheaper in the long run._\n&nbsp;\nThat's right. Many torrent sites are now charging money for you to use their services. Like, dude .. give me a break - if you're gonna pay to watch movies or listen to music, just go on iTunes or NetFlix and pay for it legally. You save time also, because you won't have to dig through all the crappy stuff hoping to get a decent audio/video quality.. or worse yet, Portuguese subtitles!\n&nbsp;\nAlso, the whole concept of a seedbox is ludicrous. Torrenting is a hobby. It's about being part of the online community, about sticking it to the man. Seeding shouldn't be a chore - it's basically the same as being a DJ, you do it for the love of music, for the love of film .. and also for the status - you want to be known as the provider of all the dank music remixes and all the quality films that everybody wants to download. \n&nbsp;\nHope that soaks it in a little. **We torrent because it's FREE.** Torrenting should only ever be done because it's free, either because you're a broke college student who can't afford to go to the video store, who can't afford netflix, or working minimum wage, or whatever. Otherwise, you may as well go legal and pay for media, legally. Better yet - go to the movies.",

			"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AmMV-Bmhh8\n&nbsp;\nBeen recently thinking about dabbling into bitcoin, so I've spent a couple of days doing my research. lol\n&nbsp;\nIt's not like I have anything to lose, really. If anything, it would be a perfect way to channel my autism into something at least remotely useful. I'm pretty broke .. 23 years old, speak 4 languages .. have video editing skills, photo editing skills, sound editing skills, basic web design skills, soldering skills, advanced laptop & pc repair skills, basic knowledge in electronics, uh... can use power tools, can grow vegetables, can brew my own alcohol, can cook the best pizzas ever, etc.\n&nbsp;\nAnd yet, it often seems as if the more skills you have, the less attractive you become to an employer. The only work-experience I have is working in fast food, retail and construction, and I was lucky to be able to get those jobs because, I was referred to them by family members. I'll make a couple of bucks repairing laptops here and then, but most people just throw their computers away and buy themselves a new one.. it's a dying trade, really.\n&nbsp;\nHowever, despite the miserable job opportunities, globalization, automation, etc... the greatest thing about the 21st century is the digital world. Machines are our only hope, our only salvation, really. They may be taking our jobs, but that just means we have to work less. The sooner they take our jobs, the better, I'd say .. that way, we'll have no choice but to embrace a Universal Basic Income, to enable the survival of humanity.\n&nbsp;\n**Anywhoo .. back to the topic of bitcoin** - let's just say it's not going to make me a lot of money. Let's just also say, that my electricity is included in my rent bill, and is always the same, so if I could just make an extra 20 bucks a week, that would be a huge improvement in my quality of life. I could probably just use bitcoin in order to buy stuff online, and then re-sell it at a slightly higher price on auction sites. My living costs are ridiculously low, and I can also survive on $20 worth of food a week. \n&nbsp;\nI also have a lot of spare time on my hands. I share a house with 20 people.. have even grown weed in here before, and nobody even noticed the surge in my electricity usage. I could even re-use some of my weed-growing equipment for my bitcoin mine, now that's lying around collecting dust. ^^",
