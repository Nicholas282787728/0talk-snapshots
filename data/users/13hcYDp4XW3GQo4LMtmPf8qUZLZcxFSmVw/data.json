It's quite backwards, yes.\n\nEdit: I meant, you'd have to run your own server if you'd want something that works like ZeroID.\nBut there are alternative approaches, like [Nanasi text board](http://127.0.0.1:43110/16KzwuSAjFnivNimSHuRdPrYd1pNPhuHqN/), where the private key is embedded into the application so everyone can sign the public key themselves in order to register.
