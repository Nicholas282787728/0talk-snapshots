It uses a mix of a central authority list filled by it's dev, along with a collection of dev approved user submissions. At the moment, the index count is wrong, since there's several sites indexed multiple times. IMO it's not very functional, but it was what we had to work with for a long time.\n> Kaffiene (my search engine) is indeed a clone of zerosearch. I removed the user-submission aspect, since it just queued them up without adding. However, when I finished cloning it, Kaffiene had an identical amount of sites. I then took the liberty of adding a few more. I noticed earlier today ZeroSearch added quite a few as well. IMO, Kaffiene is more usable, and provides more or less all the same sites.\n> Bwoi is a new one that only indexes and searches the ZeroName sites.\n> Perhaps I'm biased, but I'd say usability goes: Kaffiene > ZeroSearch > Bwoi.\n> Either way, I'm planning on continually updating Kaffiene with new features/results. I'm currently looking into how to automatically grab new sites to index. As always, I intend to keep functionality and quality search results as a top priority for Kaffiene. Which are two issues I constantly have trouble with on the competing search engines.\n\nThe sites needed to be manually checked to prevent spam, so they were added to a queue.  How is that worse than your current way of receiving sites through zeromail?",

There's also the option to add a site manually in case the crawler misses your site for some reason, although I'll eventually remove that link once I am sure the crawler works properly.\n\nI should make a post explaining that here.",
