			"body": "Has anyone tried running ZeroNet on a mesh network without the traditional internet infrastructure? Is it possible to do this yet? I read somewhere that it still uses a central tracker to connect peers, rather than something like DHT. Also, the central reliance on ZeroName, along with Namecha.in (which isn't even a part of zeronet!) seems problematic.\n\nI feel ZeroNet really needs to be able to sever any connection with the regular clearnet, and be able to ran on mesh networks in order to really embrace the idea of decentralization, as well as be able to take off and become a useful tool, rather than just an interesting play-thing.\n\nA decentralized meshnet combined with a decentralized web seems like a match made in heaven. Combine that with the other P2P technologies, and you'd effectively be able to ignore and ditch the ISP monopolies, as well as prevent any sort of bullying by large companies.\n\nAs it stands, ZeroNet still relies on ICANN to distribute IP addresses, domain names (the Namecha.in domain), and relies on various internet backbone companies in order to distribute the data. This is still dangerously centralized in my opinion.\n\nIs this on the to-do? Is it even on nofish's radar? What's everyone's thoughts on such a thing?",

			"body": "Scraping zites for content is inherently problematic, due to the way ZeroNet functions. For a typical site, you just send a request to the page, get the page content, and do as you please. However, doing this on a ZeroNet site results in getting the ZeroNet wrapper, rather than the page itself. Instead, you have to resolve the javascript and load the iframe, and *then* grab the iFrame's content.\n\nAFAIK, there's no clean way to do this in Javascript.\n\nZeroMail comes with some echobot scripts that manages to scrape the page to look for email. I've adapted this script to work in a general fashion (since I was changing it to scrape site lists for Kaffiene). [Here's the generalized script.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MgHVPCE1ve6QfKrgsqCURzRj72HrRWioz/?1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh_3)\n\nAs you can see it requires the selenium library along with phantomjs, which is a piece of software that runs websites and properly resolves the page.\n\nI was wondering what other solutions there might be, that don't rely on using selenium/phantomjs, or may even be entirely javascript.\n\nFrom my understanding, this is the problem that merger sites are meant to solve: a local/client way (javascript/coffeescript) to grab content from other ZeroNet sites.\n\nThoughts?",

I know it's the same for you guys, since we have a very small, not very active community here. So have at it: what's so great that's driving you away from ZeroNet and back to the clearnet?\n\nFor me, I always wander back to Reddit for the news, varied discussions, and active userbase. But we already have a Reddit-clone here, but we *do* have a lack of news and discussions. And all the news sites inevitably point back to clearnet. I've also noticed a huge lack of images/pictures here. Is it because there's not really a need? Or because there's not a platform to upload pictures?

Let's say that when content is published, all the reachable peers have reached their space limit, will the content never publish ?\n\nWell it's always published on your computer. If users reject to raise their limit (it'll prompt you, or you  can do it manually by dragging the top right icon to the left and changing the value), then they just won't sync AFAIK. Each user has a set limit, which I think can be adjusted by the site owner. Sites themselves aren't actually limited to a particular size, but IIRC anything over 10mb has a prompt.

Kaffeine's is a clone of zerosearch with slight changes in the source code and fewer indexed sites, I'm not sure why anyone would prefer it to zerosearch.\n> Bwoi doesn't look like it has been updated in a while, but it does have an original source code. It only has 139 results though, around half as many results as ZeroSearch.\n\nZeroSearch was the first one. It uses a mix of a central authority list filled by it's dev, along with a collection of dev approved user submissions. At the moment, the index count is wrong, since there's several sites indexed multiple times. IMO it's not very functional, but it was what we had to work with for a long time.\n\nKaffiene (my search engine) is indeed a clone of zerosearch. I removed the user-submission aspect, since it just queued them up without adding. However, when I finished cloning it, Kaffiene had an identical amount of sites. I then took the liberty of adding a few more. I noticed earlier today ZeroSearch added quite a few as well. IMO, Kaffiene is more usable, and provides more or less all the same sites.\n\nBwoi is a new one that only indexes and searches the ZeroName sites.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased, but I'd say usability goes: Kaffiene > ZeroSearch > Bwoi.\n\nEither way, I'm planning on continually updating Kaffiene with new features/results. I'm currently looking into how to automatically grab new sites to index. As always, I intend to keep functionality and quality search results as a top priority for Kaffiene. Which are two issues I constantly have trouble with on the competing search engines.",

How is that worse than your current way of receiving sites through zeromail?\n\nIt's not. A user request system is nice, but it's ultimately useless. There's no reason to have a queue system that's mostly for the dev of the site taking up bandwidth and site storage space. It'd work better if users of the site could vote on 'good' sites. But as it stands, that entire functionality is useless without an active dev. There's the implication that the queue is autochecked when it's not. Making it more or less the same as the other sites.\n\nPersonally, I removed this because it's dishonest (the queue is equivalent to just asking the dev to add the site) and it takes up space. it also makes the site clunkier. It's not a fault for having it, but I just see no point in it. ZeroSearch honestly has much bigger problems than doing something with the queue system.",

It has a note to message me if you don't see your site, but there's no actual request system. I'm confused at why you're trying to find fault in that. Functionally, it's identical. I just removed unneeded code.\n\n>Doesn't the same apply to yours?\n\nMine doesn't have a request system at all. But yes, mine is working off a central authority list managed by me. IIRC, every search engine is equivalent in this regard at the moment.\n\n>Again, same goes for yours. You kept the same site and just changed the dev.\n\nI cloned the site, sure. But it's not really the same any more. And won't be in the future.\n\n>As I see it, you basically cloned my site, changed a couple lines to make it show the tags and remove the search limit, added your name on it and claimed it as your own. How is that in any way not dishonest.\n\nI explicitly stated I cloned it on my blog. Cloning websites is a feature of ZeroNet. Either way, in the next revision of the site I'll be getting rid of most of the existing code. My main intention was to provide a more functional ZeroSearch. Which I seem to have accomplished. I'm confused at why you're angry. If you don't want your site cloned, don't upload it to ZeroNet. Anyone is free to clone Kaffiene. I have no problems with that.

Those millions of people who just want to click a button and have their content appear on the page. Markdown is fine, as we see people on reddit use it just fine despite having no coding experience. However, how many of those users would, say, be comfortable digging into the html and javascript of a site to customize it? Hell, even a lot of reddit *moderators* don't care to do that and just copy+paste important stuff they like (full themes, generators for stuff, etc).\n\nAnd back in the day with myspace we saw a similar thing happen.

I see ZeroNet quite similarly to how Myspace or even something like Geocities was back in the day: where everyone has their own little site customized to their taste.\n\nHowever, I *do* see this as an opportunity to educate people on how stuff *actually* works, and get them digging into code and learning about how websites work, rather than continue to rely on buttons.\n\nAll that being said, I love markdown.

I mean: in my country torrenting is illegal, so I always have to use a proxy to use my torrent client. Is this also necessary here in ZeroNet? are the real IPs shared somewhere? Is there any extra precaution I should take?\n> Thanks\n\nZeroNet does not hide traffic. Which is why there's included  Tor support, and if you're overly cautious, you might want to use a VPN. Though I'm confused. You say 'torrenting is illegal'. Do you mean the protocol itself? Even companies like Blizzard and Microsoft use torrents to distribute their software and updates. And plenty of legal content is distributed through it. On top of that,  torrents themselves can be used for plenty of legal activities, like browsing ZeroNet.\n\nIf you're *actually* questioning about 'Play', then treat those torrents exactly as you would torrents you get on the clearnet. Because that's literally what they are: reposted magnet links. They seem to be all Rarbg links. So if you use a VPN or w/e for those, then you'll obviously want to use it for the movies you get off Play.\n\nZeroNet itself does not actually torrent the movies. Unless, of course, a movie is included as part of a website that you connect to (at which point the site would take a long time to load). It also wouldn't be prey to the typical ways that companies catch people torrenting (through looking at the IP swarm), since ZeroNet is it's own network and doesn't connect to people outside of it.\n\nIf you're planning on using ZeroNet itself (not using it to mirror links) to do illegal things, then you might want to get extra protection.",

If we make search plugin for zeronet (python) it can indexes all user sites ( sites what user seeds) and broadcast index to DHT network (like yacy do) and that plugin should have zero api, so if you want to find some information in network you send request to DHT and recursively find what you want (like yacy do). \n\nThis won't happen. I was talking with nofish about crawling sites. He doesn't want anything that could automatically 'reveal' sites that may be intentionally hidden. So any sort of crawling, or DHT searching, or w/e is off limits. Which means a few things: 1) it won't ever be included as a python script, meaning it has to be JS, or a separate download. 2) It won't have native support, meaning that the results would be inherently limited. 3) There's still no way to grab content, making the search practically useless.\n\nI think the actual future of the search engines is probably going to be merger-sites, where various site indexes link out their list of sites, search engines grab and merge those, and then search through them. That way, users can select which indexes they want to search through, sites can be added by any participating peer, and it still works in the manner that's intended by ZeroNet.",

Regular movie torrents from play didn't seem to work with my test, but I dunno if that was just shoddy example code, a shoddy connection, or just a bad torrent. Or if it legit didn't work with those torrents. The web torrent site says you need special \"webrtc enabled\" torrents in order for them to work. And those torrents need to be seeded by a 'webrtc enabled' client. Of which there's seems to basically be none.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it didn't at all store the file on my computer after the test. Presumably it was in the cache. Seeding doesn't happen after the user leaves the page. So all stuff would either have to be explicitly seeded with an external app, or the users would have to remain on the page while they seed.\n\nThis would be fine if lots of people were accessing the content, like popular movies on play. It's not so good for a video sharing site like youtube or vimeo which might have unpopular videos.\n\nIf it worked for regular torrents (my quick test showed it didn't), then it'd be brilliant for it. Just have the users upload magnet links/torrents, and then stream them. You can already do this with regular torrents, along with a streaming client like Playback.\n\nIPFS seems like a better way to go, but I found it was *really* slow to stream content. I dunno if that was because I didn't set it up right, or if it was just legit slow.\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of *regular* torrents, so that users can freely use a torrent client of their choice, or use the built in one.

It's all out in the open for people to read/copy/etc.\n\nI've always used the term 'open source' in this manner (that you can read all of the code for something). But indeed, just because something is open source (that is, you can read the code) does not mean it's inherently licensed to be freely redistributed/modified.\n\nWhen I joined ZeroNet, I figured the 'clone able' option was more for ease of use: to default the data and make it easy for sites to be copied, rather than the long way around. Even the official [zeronet blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:3:How+to+have+a+blog+like+this) explains how to copy a site without using the 'clone' button.

Talking about cryptocurrencies was rather misleading.\n> I basically want to try and create turn based games, using internal messaging (like ZeroChat) to publicly update the state of the game to players and observers.\n> For my purpose it sounds like I can just have players use an incremental move number (0, 1, 2, etc), and if a player tries to cheat by sending \"double moves\" they will have to have signed both moves, which I guess could be detected and then the player will be considered forfeit by everyone watching the game.\n\nAh, this is completely doable. You can either just have the client check the moves and only display the latest/earliest (much like how [ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:home) only displays the latest update). Or you can use a server backend that visitors send messages to in order to submit their move. Something like ZeroID (to register unique names) or ZeroBoard (send messages to server which then posts for you).\n\nJust do this as you would any regular HTML/JS app, or introduce a python/php/etc backend if needed (though that removes the decentralization).\n\nDouble spend is still  an issue, obviously. Since the blockchain/bitcoin is the first solution to that problem. Cryptocurrencies are unique because they guarantee that the coin is unique and unable to be spent twice with no central authority. You either need a central authority to validate, or you need to trust the users (either client). The nature of ZeroNet allows someone to delete or change the content they've uploaded at any time. So that wouldn't really work well for a game, since cheating could happen. So you're probably stuck with either centrally checking it, or figuring out some other solution. Perhaps you could do a 'move verification' thing. Have 3 players in a game, and then make sure 2 of the 3 sign off on a move for it to be accepted. Bitcoin market places do this to ensure transactions aren't scams and to ensure things don't mess up.",

				"body": "> if it would be feasible to open a torrent site akin to kickasstorrents on zeronet with minimal hardware investment.\n\nThere's already a site like this: [ZeroTorrent.bit](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zerotorrent.bit). And yes, all websites on ZeroNet require minimal hardware, since the hosting is decentralized.\n\n>I'm asking because I find it hard to imagine how a site with a 'large amount' of user generated content can be decentralized.\n\nDepends on how much you're talking about. For reference, the pirate bay database comes in at 700mb or so, and contains: \"names, descriptions, comments, seeder and leecher info, date of upload, size info and quality marks (only for some torrents, before before TPB took it down).\" Remove the extra information and leave the magnet links and titles and you get down to 75mb. That's more than small enough to host on ZeroNet. Albeit, you'll likely need to use the 'optional files' feature that allows visitors to download/seed only some of the files (stuff viewed).\n\n>Ideally the site owner should not need to be online constantly for the site to run normally (only to update features or fix bugs).\n\nYup, ZeroTorrent is already like that.\n\n>So in order for the users to be able to login and add content without the 'central server', the user database would have to be available to every peer. In order not to compromise the privacy of the users it must be possible for every user to encrypt his own private user data into this user database. Also as admin of the site one might want to also look in on some of this private data. So maybe the private user data needs to be also encrypted using the site owners public key as a duplicate.\n\n>Is something like that feasible or a pipe dream?\n\nYou're essentially describing how the DB system works for ZeroNet sites in general. Keep in mind the 'login and add content' is something you literally just did here on ZeroTalk. Instead of a question, all you'd have to do is post a magnet link and some info. To quickly summarize how it works, each user has permission to upload a 'data.json' file with their contributions to the site. These json files are aggregated into an SQLite database which is then accessed by the site. Each user's contributions are only able to be modified by the user (and perhaps the site owner). And there's even options to make them completely encrypted private, like in the case of ZeroMail.",

Any automated maintenance (like crawlers and the like) either require a dedicated host that has access to ZeroNet, or for you to do it by hand.\n\nA quick example would be the echobot on ZeroMail. It's a python script running on a centralized/dedicated host that essentially acts as another user (such as the site's owner).  I actually have been toying with the concept of decentralized crawlers for my search engine [Kaffiene.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit) Though unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a reliable way of doing that.

				"body": "Yea, I've heard of yacy. Obviously decentralized search engines (for anything) is possible if you have people running code for it. The issue is using ZeroNet as a platform to do that. The javascript for each site is ran like a typical website. Once you leave the site, the code no longer runs. See [ZeroTube](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FUQPLXHimgCvYHH7v3bJXspJ7bMBUXcEb) for why that's an issue. The videos magnet links get uploaded, and while the user is on the page it seeds through webtorrent. But once they leave, the video becomes unseeded and effectively dead. On top of that, there doesn't seem to be a way to escape the site's sandbox, making it impossible to crawl clearnet for stuff anyway (not that users would agree, as many come to zeronet as an alternative web).\n\nYacy is able to do what it does because it runs in the background while users visit regular web pages. It logs that activity and crawls the visited pages. I thought up a similar idea for kaffiene: grab the user's list of seeded sites. Unfortunately this solutions was cockblocked by nofish, as grabbing a list of seeded sites is only for admin/official sites, making it impossible to use otherwise. For a torrent crawler, this method wouldn't work at all.\n\nOne solution might be to have a python script, or zeronet plugin that users can download and set up, that helps crawl for torrents or w/e else. They'd still be posted in the user-driven way, but it'd be automated. Perhaps that'd work?\n\nEither way, the big thing is that websites don't really have a backend here. It's just a frontend that's decentrally hosted. So trying to do backend stuff is likely going to have to be centralized (or you could come up with your own decentralized backend separate from zeronet).",

You can technically move the Zeronet folder itself to another location, but your site still has to be stored in /Zeronet/data or w/e. It has nothing to do with the sandboxing.\n\nThe issue I see is that you'd have to manually configure each site, or else keep the same folder structure for the sites which sort of defeats the purpose (unless you wanted the zites in /documents and the zeronet app in /apps).

Then run `brew install tor` to download/install the tor daemon (they have a mac app for the browser, but just ignore that). After it's done downloading and installing, navigate to the `/usr/local/etc/tor` folder on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to open finder and hit `cmd+shift+g` and paste it in there. You should see a `torrc.sample` file. Copy that and rename the copy to just `torrc` with no extension. Open it up in a text editor (presumably a plain text one like [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to prevent auto-formatting from messing it up. Avoid using mac's built-in one.) Look for `#ControlPort 9051` and simply remove the \\#. Two lines down you should see `#CookieAuthentication 1` remove the \\# from this one too. After that, save up and launch tor using `tor start` in the terminal. After this, restart zeronet and it'll run with tor. If you want to use tor for every connection (rather than just having one for a bridge or to access tor-only peers) then on the zero net homepage, click on the tor button in the top right, and hit 'enable tor for every connection' at the bottom. Then restart zeronet. You can disable it in the same way.\n\nHope that helps. That's how I got mine set up. No torbrowser though, if you wanted to use that.\n\nEdit: I converted this quick walkthrough into [a guide over on my blog](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit/?Post:22:New+blog+post) Please share that rather than this post when sharing how to do this.

And since it's my hub, I can manually adjust that when needed.\n\nThe big issue is residual posts. If you comment or like something on a hub, it's posted in that hub. Not your own.

Users might be posting to several hubs, but joining multiple hubs has caused problems for ZeroMe.  I think Kaffie has said the problems are mainly due to design flaws in ZeroMe; maybe a categorized site is possible now.\n\nThe issue isn't with the hubs. The hubs are just collections of data. The issue that happen(ed/s) with posting in multiple hubs is the display logic that ZeroMe uses. it assumes stuff from 'posts' only comes from a single hub, where in reality it can come from multiple. All you'd really have to do is keep the multiple hubs distinctly separate, rather than assuming that only one can have posts.\n\n'joining a hub' is really just planting down the posts/bio/avatar/etc. info on that particular hub. For a generic torrent site, the 'posts' would be submissions, and would be properly categorized into the various hubs. There wouldn't be a conflict, since they'd be explicitly in different categories (hubs). What ZeroMe does is treat all the comments/likes/posts/etc. as if they're all one big zerome site.

				"body": ">Does anybody have a good explaination for how merger sites such as ZeroMe work?\n\nThe merger feature is broken up into two parts: A hub site which contains only data. And a viewer/merger site which grabs multiple hub sites and 'merges' them. You can replace either part: you can keep the same hub sites and replace the viewer, or keep the viewer and replace the hub sites.\n\n>If I am seeding a hub, am I by default able to view it in ZeroMe?\n\nYes. Any hub you're seeding, you can view in ZeroMe (provided, of course, that it's a zerome hub).\n\n>When I post something, does it go to the first hub I joined, or does it go to all of them?\n\nWhen you join a hub, that hub gets initialized with your profile and post data. When you post something, it goes to the hub that you initialized. There's currently a bug where if you initialized two different hubs, things will glitch. You can see which hub it'll post to by looking at the link to your profile, it'll contain the hubsite address.\n\n>If it only goes to one hub, am I able to switch which hub I post to?\n\nThere is no official way to do this, no. I wrote a guide on how to manually switch hubs [here.](kaffie.bit/?Post:25:How+to+change+your+ZeroMe+Hub) Though if you have existing followers, ZeroMe will glitch a bit. The lack of switching hubs is purely due to how ZeroMe works, and not an issue with the merger/hub feature.\n\n>Am I only allowed to have a profile on one hub or do I have a profile on all of my hubs?\n\nThe profile, as mentioned earlier is stored in your initialized hub. There's nothing technically stopping you from including this data on the other hubs. However, the ZeroMe merger site isn't written to support this, and glitches. ZeroMe expects you to have a profile on only a single hub. And indeed, there's no real benefit to having a profile on different hubs. For merger sites in general, a 'profile' isn't actually a part of the API. So you can forego it altogether, or allow users to make 'posts' on every hub (just like they can with comments).\n\n>Can I comment on somebody's post from a different hub? What happens if they aren't seeding the particular hub that I joined first? What would happen?\n\nYes, this is the whole point of a merger site. Your posts on other hubs are stored in your user folder on that site. If you are commenting on a post that's on a different hub, your comment will be viewable to anyone seeding that hub (which is the same group of people able to see the parent post). If, however, they are only seeding your home hub, and not the other hub, they won't be able to see the post. People only see content that's posted on/to hubs they are seeding. Comments and likes are stored in the hub they're commented/liked on. So if someone can see the post, they can see the likes and comments.",

				"body": "ZeroNet uses .bit domains resolved through a ZeroNet site. The default resolver is [zeroname.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroname.bit) ZeroName gathers it's list by connecting to the [Namechain](http://namecha.in/) website and grabbing a list of valid ZeroNet names.\n\nZeroNet also has an option to resolve using a local copy of Namecoin, or to configure your own domain name site.\n\nBy obtaining a domain name for your site, the links shorten to something like [http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit.](http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffie.bit) Still long, but much shorter. As you may have been aware with ZeroMe, you can see that the domain name has made it a bit shorter. The extra stuff at the end is site-specific parameters, which varies from site to site.\n\n---\n\nThe big issue, then, is the ugly localhost:port at the beginning. There's two ways of fixing this, and neither are official. The first is to either download the [ZeroNet chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zeronet-protocol/cpkpdcdljfbnepgfejplkhdnopniieop?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog), which is semi-officially supported (stuff like ZeroMe adjusts for it). Or you can head over to the [kaffie.bit protocol test page](http://127.0.0.1/kaffie.bit/test.html) and download the .pac proxy file to configure the `http://zero/<address>` style urls along with direct http://name.bit support.\n\nThere's also an option on that page to configure the `zero://` protocol, which is entirely unofficial, but cleans up links a lot (the end result is: `zero://kaffie.bit`). However, the way this protocol is handled only works on firefox (and likely clones), and doesn't clean up the url bar, it just makes links look nicer (which is pointless if people can't resolve them).\n\nThe big issue with both methods is that the purpose of clean links is to share them. However, neither the `http://zero/` nor the `zero://` methods are official, and thus not all users have them (again, refer to the test page to see which work for you). Hell, even the localhost:port bit becomes non-standard, with the presence of proxies and people customizing their port. Ultimately there's not really a clean solution to all of this, and it remains to be one of ZeroNet's biggest problems.",

Best you can do is treat it and move on.\n\n>It's a mental disorder, linked to a small but consistent abnormality in the brain, and like most mental disorders and illnesses (i.e. clinical depression) there isn't a cure either, only treatment.\n\nNo. It's not. Gender dysphoria, as described in the DSM-V is a mental illness, not a disorder. It's not linked to any abnormality in the brain, but rather an improper responding to sexed hormones. Which is why it's treated with hormone replacement. And yes, it's been cured. This is the type of idiocy I was talking about.\n\n> I could point you to a dozen books written by certified, professional psychiatrists, but they all say the same thing: avoidance and denial are absolutely, completely ineffective at treating anyone with a mental disorder: anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, whatever.\n\nI don't disagree. I'm well read on psychology and mental health. Gender dysphoria, and being trans, are not a mental disorder.\n\n>And indulging in a disorder, i.e. normalizing suicide, or chemically and surgically imitating the opposite sex hurts people, badly, and permanently, and it's absolutely reprehensible for any medical professional to permit it.\n\nGreat strawman right here. No. Transitioning, hormone replacement, and surgery do *not* make people worse off. What makes people worse off is ignoring the problem. There's a reason untreated trans people have a 40% suicide rate while post-op reduces that dramatically.\n\n> So you know what my soon-to-be wife and I do, concerning dysphoria?\n\nSolve the problem? It's pretty straight forward, and treatment works almost immediately.\n\n>Find an effective therapist, learn to live with it, not reject it, or indulge in it, \n\nHave fun with that, I'd rather not live my life eternally depressed. Thanks. You do realize talk therapy doesn't help with a hormone problem, right? And that it simply gets worse with age?\n\n>and stay away from incredibly reckless practices like hormone therapy and surgery, the kinds of things that ruin people's lives.\n\nExcept it has an 80%+ satisfaction rate. One of the highest in medicine. If transitioning is 'reckless and ruins people's lives' then certainly all medicine and medical treatment must. Given everything else has a lower satisfaction rate.\n\n>Because you know what kind of people are able to accept their problematic circumstances, recognize reality, and endeavor to be happy despite it? Grown up, fucking adults.\n\nGrown fucking adults don't deny science and reality in favor of fantasies of \"I'll just get over it magically\".",

In most cases this means only trans or intersex people will get it, but there have been cases where cis people have gotten it for a variety of reasons (side effects of other drugs, forcefully transitioned, willfully transitioned, etc).

You literally do a brain transplant ala the one coming up? I think trans people in general would be pretty excited at that.\n\n> How do you think they would feel about that?What if they are stuck like that for the rest of there life?\n\nIf you did such a brain transplant on a cis (not trans) person, they'll almost certainly experience gender dysphoria due to conflicting hormones and anatomy. There's been quite a few cases that demonstrate this. The most famous is [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) who's a cis guy that was forcefully transitioned.\n\n> There brains are healthy, and the bodies are healthy, so what is the problem exactly?\n\nThis is the case for trans people. The issue is the gender/sex conflict. The brain expects a certain physiology and certain hormones. Examples unrelated to sex would be stuff like phantom limb syndrome.\n\n> The sexually dysmorphic differences in a body happen due to the sex hormone balance at multiple stages of a persons life.For many things, once developed, it is \"set\", meaning that changing the balance later wont change it much or at all.\n\nMost development happens within the womb and then later at puberty. Pubertal changes can sometimes be undone (depending on the exact trait/change we're talking about). But yes, several sex traits can't be undeveloped (voice, breasts, reproductive organs, genitals, etc).\n\n>The brain is sexually dysmorphic (why wouldn't it be?) and while it has much plasticity, it also has parts that have little or no plasticity.\n\nSure. The brain is pretty complicated as it is.\n\n> In the womb, humans start off female and are either left to develop as a female, or switched to male with a timed testosterone dump.The amount of testosterone in the dump, and the timing can be off, resulting in anomalies, like a brain that developed female in a body that developed male.\n\nYes. This is the current theory as to the cause of trans identities.\n\n> Biologically, males and females are almost identical, if you change a persons testo/estro balance during childhood to the opposite of there sex, they will develop into the opposite of there sex, voice, appearance, size and all.\n\nIndeed. Once outside of the womb, besides already developed differences, the presence of external hormones can cause the body to develop in either direction. This is why transitioning often times works much better for younger people.",
