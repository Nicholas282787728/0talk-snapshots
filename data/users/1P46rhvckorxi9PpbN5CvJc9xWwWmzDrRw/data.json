The revisions are stored locally in your .git folder and you have pace of mind that your notes are safe.\nAn owner can delete his site but if a user needs a local backup he could use a similar method to \"roll-back\" to a previous state.\nOr, since zeronet already has the clone feature a \"clone and keep in sync\" could work. Then the user would have a copy and can publish it later on.\nOr, having 2 owners of a site. To be removed there would need to be a consensus. The two or more owners would have to agree by signing with their keys for the site to be removed.",
