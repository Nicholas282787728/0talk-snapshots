Just because you're an idiot doesn't make that not true.\n> \n> Lots of cis people have genetic disorders and are not XX nor XY. Chromosomes have little bearing on sex and appearance. Seriously, go fucking learn your shit before you spew crap off like an idiot.\n> \n> Being trans is not a mental illness. Though I'd consider people who say stupid shit like the stuff you're saying to be mentally ill.\n> \n> Yes, there are cis women here. You don't believe it because you're a sexist transphobic bigot. If you don't like it here, gtfo.\n\nMen aren't women just because they want to be or they wouldn't need hormones and surgeries and propagandists like you trying to shill for them.\n\nA man thinking he is a woman or a woman thinking she's a man is as much a mental illness as that guy walking down the street yelling at birds and thinking the cia planted a transmitter in his teeth.",
