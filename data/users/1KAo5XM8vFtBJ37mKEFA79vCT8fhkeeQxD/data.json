But when I'm using my phone (Nexus 5X), the links doesn't work really good in this forum ( Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit ). I need to \"click\" multiples times in the links to make it work. Is anybody else having this issue?\n\nI feel like this is a problem with the wrapper, I don't see why it'd be an issue with the proxy.",
