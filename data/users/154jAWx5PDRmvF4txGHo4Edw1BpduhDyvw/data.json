			"body": "I would love to see ZeroNet more widely used. Sadly non-techies are unlikely to install Python and then figure out how to run and use it as it is. Unless they can access it just like any other online service things are unlikely to ever become popular.\n\nSo, would it be at all possible to run a \"bridge\"? Run ZeroNet on a server, and then allow access to anyone. We could then strongly encourage running your own node, but to those not capable of doing so access is still possible.",

BBS, ant then Web 1.0.I think ZeroNet has a lot of potential but it's too early to start bridging with the regular joe. ZeroNet is for a censorship free internet, and allowing people with sensibilities in now could actually hinder that goal.\n\nNow that you bring that up... I totally agree! Thank you for pointing it out.",
