As a VPN is an arguably more secure alternative to Tor, I think it's safe to assume that such a feature would be worthwhile.  It could be a toggle on the main interface in the same dropdown as the update, shutdown, etc for ZeroNet.",

There will also be a message next to the display of the limit telling you to contact him when you reach 80% or so of the limit. So when the time comes you can just write him a quick ZeroMail, I did that a couple of days ago and got my limit raised.\n\nAwesome; thanks for the help!",
