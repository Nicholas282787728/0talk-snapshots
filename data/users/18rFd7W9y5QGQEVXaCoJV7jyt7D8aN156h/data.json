Retroshare doesn't even have a mobile client, AFAIK, so comparing Telegram and Retroshare might be like comparing apples and bananas. That said, Retroshare does look interesting.\n\nyou should never use telegram at all",

You don't have to get family to migrate, just use whatsapp as an alternative for more private stuff if you need to along side wechat, you can download the APK directly and sideload it onto an Android device, whatsapp will then update itself when needed.\n> You can contact me on zeromail at chinabiz, or on bitmessage at BM-NBEzNpescY4BCsqpB9T8E8xsVLiw6zDq\n\nF-Droid has a libre version with all the crap removed",
