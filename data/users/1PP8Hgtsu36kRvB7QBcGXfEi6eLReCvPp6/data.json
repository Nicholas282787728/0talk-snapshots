They do not have anything to be afraid if the game is good, right?..if they want my money, they have to prove to me that their game is really that good or at least has what they promised to have in the game.\nToday we're paying for a half game, for a unfinished game or for a game that looks like that comes from early access but with a full price. Now that I made myself crystal clear, do you think its fair to pay for something you don't know its one thing or another?\nyes, there are reviews...but do you know that a lot of them is payed to say good things about that game, its called marketing. I will not compromise my money (that does not grows from the trees now a days) for something that i have not tested. After all, testing by yourself, is always the best way to say if its really worth buying or not.\nIf the game is worth it, i'll gladly pay for it.",
