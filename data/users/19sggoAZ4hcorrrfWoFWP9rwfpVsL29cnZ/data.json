My current dev version of zerotorrent has some bugs that need resolving (and i'm procrastinating) relating to optional_files improvements so it should scale better.  At the same time i'm trying to rope in some designers to help with the interface.\n> A couple of pain points:\n> \n> Lack of database migrations (think south/django).  There is already data in two formats on ZeroTorrent.\n> Lack of proper sanitization of user data (can be done in coffescript/js but there is nothing to stop people running modified script or creating the json data files manually containing malicious js; the solution to this might be to sanitize on read).\n> Difficult to prevent spam without moderation or it being a general pain in the ass (I have been thinking of doing some kind of POW like bitmessage to post, and clients could ignore posts without enough work,in theory this can be done in javascript)\n> Difficult to (reliably) setup a testing environment with real data, without fucking up prod site. \n> \n> I have also been anticipating the merger sites feature and I am taking a look to see how it could be used to further help scaleability.\n> If I can take a couple of weeks out I will evaluate all this and am considering starting from scratch and doing things less hacky this time (which would involve launching on a new address; the .bit would be updated, but we again fall on the issue of migrating user data, unless i create a single user to reupload everything currently on zerotorrent but comments will be tricky and attriution will be lost).\n> I am lurking around from time to time and I hear your calls for ebooks section and I promise to include this on the next update, however, as mentioned, reliably testing is a bit of a bitch and I am quite apprehensive about touching the live site as I have previously fucked it up due to database migration (change of schema) issues. \n> Need to get moving on this ........ \n> Btw, not beelzebub.\n\nTo make it easier for everyone, should start from scratch, the gang helps upload again, ta missing a cleaner version of torrent sites!",

So if that is indeed how it is then we're back to square one. Namely, sitting on an ever-growing index of torrents with nowhere stable to dump em. And with all this back-and-forth hubs business thats going on I'm not even sure if a manageable index site is viable yet, there needs to be at least one hub per category and there are going to be at least 8 or so, right? TV, Movies, Software, Music, Anime, Books/Magazines/Comics, XXX, Mobile Apps....and that is without any sub-categories, not to mention the community hubs. The whole thing really needs to be nailed down tight before the mass-uploading can begin because believe me, its going to take a fair while to upload tens of MILLIONS of torrents on a decentralized network such as this, you need to be sure you're doing it right.\n\nI agree with you!",
