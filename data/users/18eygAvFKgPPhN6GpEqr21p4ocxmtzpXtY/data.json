The fact that seemingly technical people participate in such bullshit discussions is a downer. Go read some papers on Freenet or Tor to understand how little can actually be made anonymous and private.\n\nWhen the term Deep Web first came about it had a different meaning than media spin has given it now. It originally simply mean a part of the web that wasn't easily accessible to people that did already know it existed, not necessarily supposedly anonymous networks like TOR. Like a website that purposely didn't list it's self in search engines and the like.",
