ZeroNet is hugely different to that as you need to use some external software just to access it. ZeroNet is much more akin to a Decentralized DarkNet which is really, really great.",

An article here talks about how ZeroIDs are pseudo anonymous and can be traced back to you.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/hackertalk.bit/?Topic:2_1HK5C3Uf8zvbbSb92ZP6EsfHKC59MXDcK9/Methodology+Find+someone+s+trace+in+ZeroNet\n\nIf you truly want to be anonymous, what you can do is to create a new ZeroID every now and then. Though I think, there's a limit to the amount of ZeroIDs you can create per IP (per hour?)",
