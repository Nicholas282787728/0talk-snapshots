This can be seen in economics, thermodynamics, genetics, and in some ways mathematics. I know it's vague, but it's what keeps me going. When nothing else works, I default to just being myself because it doesn't take any effort. I default to myself and do everything as beneficially as I can for everything, and no matter how bad things get the ride never stops. There aren't many piles of chemicals that are self-aware, let alone intelligent enough to question their own purpose. That paradox alone is the very meaning I'm trying to get at.",
