There's plenty of shit I do not want to see. But as far as I know it's still completely anonymous\n\nZeroNet sites are like torrents - they are hosted by the people that visit them. So when you visit a site, you're downloading the data from the people that have visited the site before.\n\nOf course, this means that once you've visited a site, all of the site's content gets downloaded to your PC, and you also become a host.\n\nTherefore, someone could easily get a LOT of people in trouble just by posting illicit content on to some widely used site.",
