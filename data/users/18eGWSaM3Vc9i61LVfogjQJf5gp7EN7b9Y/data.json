ZeroTorrent.bit has applications, games, TV shows and music in addition to movies. Thus, depending on what you are wanting to torrent, ZeroTorrent might be a better choice.\n\nProps to Play, however, for sourcing its content from the clearnet, and providing source links. Depends on how used you are to trawling through torrents.",
