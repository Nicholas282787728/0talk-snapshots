			"body": "I'm gay. I have seen the news today. Please don't make this about restraining Freedom even more. Please don't make it about the L, the B, the T or the Q, or worse: about _women_. Don't make it about anything else than it is: male to male homophobia. There is no _better_ culture when it comes to male homophobia so don't make it about migrants either. Male homophobia is a guy's fear of his own attraction towards other guys. It's about what your prostate does to your brain. It's just that some males have the intelligence to deal with it beyond being _afraid_ of it. Male homophobia is _all_ about stupidity.\n\nUPDATE 2016-06-15:  I have been on ZeroNet for a while. I know 99.99% of you guys are awkward virgin assholes that publicly pretend to be straight but exhibit typical homophobic closet confusion. Rings a bell ? _So_, I am just going to [drop this work in progress here](/tuetamere.bloccoq.bit/) to help you on your quest while I take care of my business on ZeroNet, trying to leave none of your narrow mind and even tighter ass unfucked.

It's tricky what ideas or ideals are referred to with this word \"love\". I know what sex is, though: it is the tropism, the motive that pulls human beings toward other human beings. It is our network protocol, a human TCP/IP over Ethernet. Sex, notably through rejection, through repression, through impossible desires and fantasies _is_ the most hurtful, tragic, destructive thing one will ever experience, _because_ it is also the most fulfilling and elevating.\n\n>  I don't understand.\n\nLet's see…\n\n> Here here.\n\nWell _this_ is where homophobia starts from. From an arbitrary sense of heightened morality that hides trouble. There is an Arcade Fire song that goes like this: \n\n_When they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it\nLook at those normals go\nWhen they get excited, they try to hide it... No!_\n\nSome try to hide it with moral authority, some with boredom, some with disgust. All of this is homophobia, all of this is incapacity to deal with homoerotic arousal susceptibility. With women it is different, women exhibiting homophobia towards their own sons, husbands, boyfriends, lovers, coworkers was best been explored by Godard in his movie _Contempt_.

It says something about Tor routers.\n\nThe message on [bloccoq.bit](/bloccoq.bit/) is a warning (in French) that says you have to have your Tor router setup properly so that your browser is able to resolve \".onion\" addresses if you want to see the videos. If you click on one of the links fanning out of the cock's mouth, for instance [Nouveau vloggeur](/nouveauvloggeur.bloccoq.bit/), the second one, there are 2 videos on this page. Both are hosted on a Tor onion service. If an error message appears when you click on either one of those 2 videos, it means your Tor proxy is not setup correctly. If everything is OK, it should take around 30 seconds to connect to the remote Tor service and the video should play.\n\nThe reason why I want to explore basic I/O in a POSIX C fork is that it gives me hope to be able to host larger files within the ZeroNet site bundles themselves and not rely on a third party solution. As it stands, you can either use IPFS and lose anonymity or use Tor and lose decentralization. Both also require extra non-trivial setup steps.",

More control over storage should come from ZeroHello for site-level information and actions, from the site-loading progress page for larger site (I think the default limit per-site should be raised to something around 200MB and the site content storage limit upgrade/downgrade system can be improved upon for sure). For file-level control within a site, something can be done with the side-panel UI.\n\nAlso, it is important to stress out that the use case I am concerned about is original, independent content and not torrent-like archiving of commercial feature-length 10-bit 444 H.265 video with surround sound that was meant for the theatre. For that, IPFS is fine. Right now, ZeroNet is perfect for text and image content where every file is less than 1MB. I want to improve on the 1MB limit because I think video bloggers and artists with disruptive things to say have nowhere to go and ZeroNet only needs small (performance) adjustments to make them feel welcome. _That_ is what I want to work on. _This_ is the use case I want to support.",

Benchmarking is an important part of testing in this case. I will see with nofish & al. when I have something worthwhile.\n\n> Better yet, would it be possible to make white-label versions of libzeronet so that organisations or groups of people can have their own versions of zeronet in a sort of world-wide secure intranet. Would it be feasible to add XAMPP support to your implementation of libzeronet?\n\nI will not commit to anything else than the use case I have explained below for now.

But: 1) If I am ever accused of childporn-related crimes because of this, I am perfectly willing to challenge the broken Law that allowed for my being tried in court in the first place. 2) If you are actually seeding illegal content, no interactive feature can protect you from a broken Law, by definition.\n\nSo: it's a good idea to leave this thread open (I wouldn't want you to censor yourself anyways) because the people that vote _for_ this are against the very ideas that motivate ZeroNet.

And one of my goals with it is to strengthen the censorship-free aspects of Zeronet. I want to actually _help_ artists and authors that need a place for their voice to even exist. Because there _are_ voices that cannot exist on the commercial centralized web today. And to me and those people, cohabitation with hate speech, child porn and any illegal or criminal content is an _infinitesimal_ price to pay compared to not even be able to (again) _exist_ otherwise in what we dare call a _free country_. I'm not even sorry for those triggered or offended by my and other's existential albeit aggressive will to foster and protect _to death_ freedoms of conscience and speech.\n\nI want to see features for _more_ disruptive content. Not _less_ of it. I'm _extremely_ annoyed with Zeronet being almost exclusively _about_ Zeronet.\n\n> I wish you good luck with the talk you're going to give at Decentralized Web Meetup\n\nThanks. Because of this thread, I will reduce the technical portion of my talk and put more time into the philosophical part of it.

Unless you know those things, it is _not_ going to be easy.
