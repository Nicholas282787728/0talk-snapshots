Tor has been compromised before i2p hasn't, that + better large file support is why I prefer i2p. Users should be able to choose if they want to be clear, connect trough i2p or tor. Also if you want a shitload of users you need a gui & n00b friendly installation. I think that zeronet has the potential to get very big, so a C or C++ port might be needed someday.",

I think zeronet + i2p is perfect for streaming websites since they are driven out of the clearnet. The Popcorn Time guys are already checking out i2p. I don't think tor will ever be good for multimedia content.",

				"body": "Really strange, I had one or two MByte per second with the i2p torrents. Good to know that the crypto part is in C. Then all zeronet needs is some awesome websites to pull users in. ^-^ The \"download, unpack, start\" is good for the alpha/early beta, advanced users have no problem with this but the casuals need guis. For zeronet to get mainstream it'll have to install with assistant (exe), autostart the service on boot etc. so the user can just press next, next, next and finish. Then get presented (auto open) a website in the browser that tells him how to use zeronet. Fast access links (like there currently already are) and a link on the desktop and/or start menu. Casual users are very very lazy they need these things. I'll be following zeronet and play around with a website or two like the rest but I need bigger filesizes for anything serious. \n\nKeep up the good work! This has the potential do become Internet 2.0 if done well.",
