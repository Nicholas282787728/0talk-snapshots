Might have to integrate with an additional decentralized network focusing on file storage, like IPFS or Storj (and I'm sure there are more, lots of interest in this tech now) for streaming and downloading bigger files.\n\nIs the tor bandwidth the only reason we can't stream big files over ZeroNet? I guess if we were to use IPFS over tor we would have the same issue then.\n\nVideo and audio streaming is quite popular on the regular web, and being able to have it decentralized with ZeroNet would be great. In fact, not supporting big files is quite limiting, even some images can easily take more than 1Mb.",

I would be more than fine having an option to block certain users. Once a user got blocked my local copy of ZeroNet should ignore any content coming from him, be it new sites, comments or anything he published in ZeroNet.\n\nThen there's the problem of automatically seeding content. Someone posts a link, you click on it and boom! you're sharing something that may be ilegal in your country. Yeah, sure you can go to your HelloZeroNet page and remove the site, but I'd rather have a new button on every page, similar to the '0' one we have in the top right corner, that allows me to seed/unseed the site I'm currently visiting. This would also allow me to visit sites which I don't necessarily want to seed.\n\nJust my two cents, I know having ideas is easy, executing them is much harder. Nofish has done an impressive work so far and I'm sure he'll come up with better solutions to all this \"undesirable content\" thing.",

This works:\n\n'''\n@keyframes slideDown {\n\t0% { transform: translateY(-100%); }\n\t100% { transform: translateY(0%); }\n}\n'''\n\nBut, removing the space between the ; and } makes it fail. In fact, if I replace that space with a tab it also fails. Can you confirm that?",
