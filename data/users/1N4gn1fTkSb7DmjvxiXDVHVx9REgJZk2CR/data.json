These files would end in a cache folder which has user-defined maxmum size, if this limit reached the best seeded file would be deleted automatically.\n\nOK, this is going to work for huge static sites, but not sure about sites with users-generated content:\n - If the site defines the optional files, the users will not be able to upload stuff - am I correct?\n - Things that are downloaded are not always worthy to be stored. My understanding is that seeders should be able to decide whether to keep something or delete it. I.e. instead of \"Like\" button there will be \"Seed\" button :)\n\n",

They are both downloaded only when requested, right?\n\n> The initial distribution could be problematic this way (after the upload you have to wait until some ppl want to see it), but to avoid this there could be \"super peers\" on high speed connection who is automatically downloads every new file and keeps it until the distribution is guaranteed.\n> My other idea to solve the initial seed problem: you would be able to friend or subscribe users and if he/she uploads a new file your client automatically downloads it and helping the distribution this way.\n\nI wouldn't worry that much about initial seeding. The creator of content will have to seed his/her work if he/she wants the content to reach the public. Seems natural.\n\n",
