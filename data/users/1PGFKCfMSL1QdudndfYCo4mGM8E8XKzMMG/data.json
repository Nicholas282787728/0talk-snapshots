I've tried to create a new one, but apparentely, it cannot be viewed by anyone else but me.\n\nThis message appears when I try to publish my new blog.\n\n\"No peers found, but your content is ready to access.\"\n\nWhen I give the blog's address to some friend, it shows the \"there are no peers\" message.\n\nMy site link is this:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/19KdvvYVFWuNPHQ2t8KVPtyS4jDUn19QKo\n\nPS: I've downloaded the new version of zeronet via wget and then I deleted the last folder and created a new one by extracting the tar file just on the same location last folder of zeronet-master was. Did I do anything wrong?\n\nI apreciate your answers.",
