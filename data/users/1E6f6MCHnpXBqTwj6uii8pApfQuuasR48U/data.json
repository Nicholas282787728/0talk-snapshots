We don't hear these stories first hand because you have no way of sending them to us. Though I knew censorship existed in China, I have never known the extent of it as so little information is available and when it is governments comply with the Chinese government to keep trade relations strong.\n\nWould you mind expressing what day-to-day internet usage is like in China, the consequences of certain actions which would be protected (in western society at least) by freedom of expression and so forth?",
