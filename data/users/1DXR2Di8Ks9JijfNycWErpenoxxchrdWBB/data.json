			"title": "Attempt to use Git over ZeroNet",
			"body": "I believe that it would be great if we could host Git repositories on ZeroNet. So I made an attempt. I created a Git remote helper named `git-remote-zeronet` which is modified from `git-remote-testgit.sh`, with the ability to auto sign & publish site after pushing, and accepts URLs like `zeronet::SITE_ADDRESS` as remote address. The site must contain a `git` directory with a bare Git repository inside. I'd prefer creating one site for each repo rather than using optional files to build a GitHub-like site.\n\nThis works really well. The only thing you need is enough peers hosting the repo. However, ZeroNet is not for large files, neither is Git for.\n\nHere is an [example](/1xxooZ7s8iDz3u56i5mNQ1XGmwF8Zvnw9/), with details on how to clone such a Git repo and how to set up your own Git repo on ZeroNet. I also made a mirror of the main ZeroNet repo at [here](/1FMH8JKKPMY4ToNYNVVo4bGNJwgh6Abzh/), as another example 😅\n\nThe next step may be implementing a gitweb-like frontend page with pure JavaScript Git parser. For now, ZeroNet is enough for hosting small projects with Git ",
