			"body": "Every site that you visit here on zn automatically goes on your list...meaning the entire contents of the site you are visiting is now on your computer.\n\nBE AWARE\nIf the site is illegal and any files of the site are on your computer, the feds can charge you with hosting an illegal site.\n\nZeronet is not as secure as we would like it to be. There are zeronet proxies that you can goto that you can see zeronet sites without going into zeronet.\n\nWe all love the idea of zeronet and have to keep it secure.\n\nIf you are a cyber security analyst or even know about hacking...if you want to get involved...lets start a group or a chat where we can all have our say and move from there.\n\nI watched the movie \"Deep Web\" and thought of the idea of p2p sites then did some research and found zeronet among others.\n\nProblem is p2p is not the most secure way but it works for what we want it to do.",
