			"body": "Hey. I thought I should post this here. If you aren't interested just move on.\n\nSo there is a YouTube channel called [Who What Were](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPR27YUyxmgwm3Wc2WSHLw) (pronounced 'Who What Where') and it produces some really great content on tech, GNU/Linux and free software.\n\nMyself and some other people from the channel's IRC\n\n    irc.geekshed.net\n    #whowhatwere\n\ndecided to make a website for the channel. We spent the last couple days casually making it together, and hosted it on ZeroNet. We are using bit.no.com as a clear web proxy so we can link to it for people who don't have ZeroNet installed. Soon the domain whowhatwere.download will direct to it too.\n\nAnyway, point being, freely licensed tech content, freely licensed site containing it, hosted on ZeroNet and accessible via the clearnet. If it sounds like your thing, check it out.\n\nTo view the site without downloading it (its just under 500mb) you can view it on bit.no.com who have cached the entire site on their servers (free hosting, booya!). You can access that [here](https://bit.no.com:43110/1PRY8bJF8kos6B91XLbAGRN99EuLVSZcXY).\n\nAs for the actual site, we tried optional files but they are bugged so we couldn't. Its just under 500mb in size and contains 11 videos from Who What Were's last month in the free webm format. If you do like the content found on the YouTube channel or the Site's proxy, please consider seeding it :)\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1PRY8bJF8kos6B91XLbAGRN99EuLVSZcXY/\n\nLike I said, this project was taken on independent of the owner though we did get their permission to host the content. This isn't advertising, it is just a project some fans put together. I hope you like it too :)",

If ZeroNet is definitely shut down then I can't think why anything would be overriding it unless you have a newer signed copy somewhere that's replacing it (this is unlikely). I'd say it's a bug but it's hard to tell. If your positive everyting is setup correctly and you're signing it correctly (it sounds to me like you are) then I'd post an issue on Github\n\nI just tried rebooting my pc and before anything else doing it. No other application was open. Still didn't work. I'm so confused. Is there a specific line of content.json I am supposed to add it to?",

Again, it keeps over writing.",
