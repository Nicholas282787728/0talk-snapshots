A few more comments:\n\n- integrate WebRTC webcam/voice communications that are encrypted and secure for web conferencing or one-on-one communications (like Firefox hello), and host developer/community town halls. \n\n- create a social media page with a  \"Facebook-like\" experience where my chosen family members could host backups of my content. This would be a decentralized Facebook experience for the more privacy-conscious.",
