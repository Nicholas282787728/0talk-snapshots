Before that happens we ought to build this place up a bit.\n\nYou have 21 days to prepare for the shitstorm, don't forget that other, more based DNS servers are still around and the fact that they're so many means the kikes will be pulling their hair out getting rid of it all. This place alone stands as a testament to that.\n\nIf you're concerned about anonymity, go to the dankweb, use a fucking Proxy, get a fucking VPN. Zeronet is NOT these things. It stands as a bunker for resilience.\nWe can say what we want here without getting shut down... A great place to still communicate under outright (shut it down) happenings.\n\nIn the mean time, we can build this place up, we can get other anons to know about it before it's too late!\n\nGodspeed you magnificent bastards, it's been an honor shitposting with you",
