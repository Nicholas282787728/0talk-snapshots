I don't want to bother regular internet users with zeronet id's.\nTake a look at how http://127.0.0.1:43110/Board.ZeroNetwork.bit/ works. It doesn't require users to be logged in. \nMaybe you can start with cloning it and add some CSS to suit your need.\n\nZeroBoard doesn't have any encryption so... you might consider using [kbpgp - Keybase's PGP for JavaScript](https://github.com/keybase/kbpgp)",
