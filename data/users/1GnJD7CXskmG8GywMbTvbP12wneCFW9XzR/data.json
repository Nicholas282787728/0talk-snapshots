For example, if a hub hosts 100 users, then every user has less than 100K quota on average. Now let's do some math: suppose on average a user has 600 posts (including comments), and every post is 150 characters (including time stamps), then on average a user will use 150*4*600/1024 = 351k. 351k is already exceeding the  quota.
