This is the biggest limitation I have experienced so far. (10MB > gives an error and won't sitePublish). Other than torrents it will be difficult to share files over the network, which may be a downer to some users.\n\n2) Setting up a ZeroID was super confusing at first since the ZeroID website wasn't working properly until I let it reload 4 times.\n\n3) It's not possible to delete an ID and/or scrub old posts, this is a privacy concern.",
