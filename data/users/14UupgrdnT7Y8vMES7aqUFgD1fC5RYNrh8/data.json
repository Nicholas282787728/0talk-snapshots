			"body": "Hi guys,I was thinking about how could we measure speed on Zeronet.First I tried the javascript method using a picture file,but that doesn't worked as all files are being downloaded only once(and the script gives error on zeronet also)\nIt would be great to know how much bandwidth can we get from zeronet.As many users have broadband internet (I have 500mbps also) it would be fun to test download speed on site hosted by 100peers for example.\nAny ideas how could we do this?",
