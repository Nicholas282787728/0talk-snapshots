I've created a Patreon for the proxy (I'm looking into creating an Ethereum smart contract), so please contribute something to the proxy if you can: https://patreon.com/user?u=3027012\n\nYes, I know the proxy is currently down. This is completely unrelated and I'm solving it right now (rebooting the VM will hopefully help).",
