Also, previous \"solutions\" required that one had to close the running ZN first.\n\n>@ax: The same goes with the Zeroverse ID, what is the advantage in having two ID systems?\n\n1. \"The reason is most likely, because people don't know \"the fact that ZeroID goes outside should be properly disclosed on the page. (Especially if it's by design)\" (1) \nZeroVerse is FORCING users to NOT **leak** their info (and also informing them **why** (2)).\" (written [here](/1K28kQFMquNzto2iQf4GGjr6oFUbC1NddE/?Poll:3-1H8oKiRa7fGgUqS1hpUtaSYLvAqkaknbkf))\n\n2. **anonymity**\n\"Votes are tied to your ZeroID, they are pseudonymous, not anonymous. With a little bit of work someone can find out what you (your ZeroID) voted for.\" (see ZeroPolls' top message)\nCurrently, with a few sql commands, I can make a profile of each voter at ZeroPoll and extrapolate info from this.\nBut soon \"you can make a throwaway account for doing things (like voting here) that you don't want tied to your main account\" (written [here](/1K28kQFMquNzto2iQf4GGjr6oFUbC1NddE/?Poll:3-1H8oKiRa7fGgUqS1hpUtaSYLvAqkaknbkf))\n\n\n\nmail.zeroverse.bit\n\nBefore announcing it to the public I've talked with @nofish (the admin of ZeroMail) about a \"clone\". My idea was actually, to include ZeroVerse in ZeroMail, but he said:\n\"I think a separate ZeroMail clone is a better idea currently\".\n\n\n> @ax: Correct me if I am wrong but isn't Zeromail already a distributed service/system? There is no hierarchy in nodes as far as I'm aware, we the nodes ARE Zeromail. Having everyone using Zeromail helps with providing cover traffic/plausible deniability.\n\nCurrently all ZeroNet sites have 1 problem: they have a **\"powerful\" admin**. There are different reasons why e.g. Mr. Murphy (or staff of 3-letter agencies, ...) can visit them, or not. But when he does and a sitePublish is done, data is manipulated/lost. All other nodes will update their versions when the central node tells it.\n\nWhen people want to go elsewhere in the ZN network, they have to start with a fresh mailbox. Their **data** does not walk with them automatically. It's kept in the \"big silo\".\nSee [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/UVp8Hr9.jpg): when I see the current mail systems it looks to me like A: centralized. \ne.g. it is not like this that everyone can set up their own email-server (barack@obama.com) and communicate with others (michelle@thebestwife.com)\nBut mail.zeroverse.com does allow at least now: \nmisterO@zeroid.bit can exchange emails with ladyM@zeroverse.bit\n\nAnd people should not take the **storage size** lightly. I'm a power user, and I get hit all the time from the limits ([limit in ZeroMail](/zeroblog.bit/?Post:30:ZeroMail+and+BitMessage+differences+), in [chat](/zeroblog.bit/??Post:24:ZeroNet+apps+have+a+max+limit+for+user+contributions+%28Content+sign+failed:+invalid+private+key%29))\nProbably only a few of you can imagine how it feels right now, to not play Goethe (a la: Sorry, I need more time with my reply, because I have to perfect it with less. In this case: hm, which email should I delete now?)\n\nWhen I delete mails, they get **also deleted** on the receiver side, which is - well... \nyou decide if that's good or not.
