However, for whatever reason I was able to increase the speeds tremendously by setting a proxy on my torrent client. I have no idea how that works, but it does.Torrent client usually doesn't matter much in how anonymous your downloads are though.\n\nWhat proxy do you use?",

First you download the file to the box (its IP is used, not yours) and then you SFTP the file down to your desktop or whatever. As long as you're using SFTP (encrypted FTP) your ISP won't be able to know what exactly you are downloading.\n\ni think this the route i will take.",
