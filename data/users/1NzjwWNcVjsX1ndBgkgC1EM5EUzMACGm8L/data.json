Can i have some help, i need a comment section to be add on every \"content page\" that will have my page, i cant use the blog template because my page wont have \"posts\" it will have little content links. I dont need the following functions, just auth, and leave a coment the same as a blog, i think this is possible and its easier than the things im trying out. I think the only information i need for the db is user_id (who comments), comment_id, content_id (content where comment is located), time when commented was posted . Can i have some help please? I ve been with this like 10hrs now :S",
