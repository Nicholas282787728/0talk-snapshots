				"body": "Revolutions are spikes in timeline of history. Fact : they do not sustain for even longer period of time. That phenomenon can be understood from \"1984\". However, we need evolution - an evolution not from competition for exploitation but, evolution by ANTI-IGNORANCE(it means we are always ignorant and at then we consecutively try to discover more and understand the discovery - use it - experiment it - fight for its freedom...i.e. to embrace anti-ignorance). That is the basis of many movements that Fights for Freedom.  It must come from within, not to be shoved by external forces or establishments. If we remain ignorant we can't be Free. \n\nI have started a website to discuss more....(still in development) try it..... \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1EfBtV7woxqR5mL7r3PyDzD3AUDYcKLaxh",
