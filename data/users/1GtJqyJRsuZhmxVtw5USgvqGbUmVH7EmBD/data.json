In other words, Zeronet has a lot of hidden circumvention servers. Block all the Zeronet servers will be a big cost for GFW.\n\nu are correct even if the GFW know u connected to a tor server after you got the files they need to go and shut down or stop every connection zeronet users make in china\nfor that reason in my opinion people should never use optional files for chinese content because the files needs to cross the GFW only once buy if files are optionals the files need to cross the GFW every time",
