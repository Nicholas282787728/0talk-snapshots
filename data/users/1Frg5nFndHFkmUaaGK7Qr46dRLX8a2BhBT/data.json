			"body": "Hello all,\n\nI have been interested for a while in using the equivalent of the p2p internet architecture (like zeronet, initially I thought about Maelstrom but this seems better so hey) to mount an open, free and unbiased new outlet which is accessible and uncensored for people in (principally) authoritarian states, a kind of 'Radio Free Europe' for the 21st Century (I know as well that Radio Free Europe was funded mostly by the Americans, but remained journalistically neutral to this fact) . An initial thought was maybe to relay BBC World Service reporting onto a zeronet platform somehow. I was looking for input on any further ideas, or proposals for cooperation with this service; which would aim ultimately to provide clarity and transparency for all.  \n\nTHANKS!!!",
