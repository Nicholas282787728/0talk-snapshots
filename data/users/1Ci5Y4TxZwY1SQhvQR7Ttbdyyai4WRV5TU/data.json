			"body": "Hello, so I want to start a debate, who do you think is better, archlinux or gentoo, and why do you think so. \n\nJust by looking on distrowatch we can see a difference in the description, for once Arch: \"Arch Linux is an independently developed, i686- and x86_64-optimised Linux distribution targeted at competent Linux users ...\" and Gentoo: \"Gentoo Linux is a versatile and fast, completely free Linux distribution geared towards developers and network professionals...\"\n\nThe description makes it look like, arch wold be more for hobbyists while gentoo is more for profesionals. Do you think this is true, motivate your opinion. \n\nAlso who do you think to be more complex, from installation to day to day use?",

But how secure would be using a private tracker?",
