When the hash of the big file was being checked, the web page still responded to scrolling and video seeking.\n\nThough it is not necessary to check the hash of the reassembled file, I worked out a way to use Web Workers in ZeroNet's `iframe` without running into any cross origin errors.\n\nIf a cross origin error causes `new Worker(\"async-hash.js\");` and `importScripts('asmcrypto.js');` to fail, putting the content of the script into a `blob:` URL can bypass this error.",
