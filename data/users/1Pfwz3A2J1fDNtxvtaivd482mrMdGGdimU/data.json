				"body": "What can I say about this... things are not always that easy. Take this example:\n\nOnce upon a time a couple of torrent programmers decided that it is important to have a p2p chat system between torrent peers. They took pascal and wrote free peer to peer software called 'sky p2p' or better known at that time as 'skyper'. But they couldn't register doman skyper.com because someone already had it, so they shorthen domain to skype. For a while it was great, it worked and was fun, but had a problem that people would have same name and no way of reserving it - there was no central server for the authentication...\n\n... cut a long story short...over some long time... & lot of money exchanging hands...& passing ownership over code...\n\nThese days Microsoft makes 'Skype for business' to replace Lync as instant messenger in enterprise environment.\n\nWhere the idea started, where it ended up?",
