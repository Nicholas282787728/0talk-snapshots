			"body": "I search around how to install ZeroNet on a Synology but didn't find anything. Try to ssh in my Synology and do the \"Other Distro or without root access\" install but it's not working…well of course…. Tried foolishly to just copy/paste the windows directory and ssh \"python zeronet.py\" it's kind of working at least in the ssh console I can see it updating but I have no idea how to connect, tried 192.168.1.xx:43110 not working obviously, I guess I have to open the 43110 port on my Synology, tried but not sure which options to select.\nAny help/ideas ?",
