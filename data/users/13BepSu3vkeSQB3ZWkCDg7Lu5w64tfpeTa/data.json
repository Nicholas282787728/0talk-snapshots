If said option is set to true, obviously people can clone the site in ZeroHello.\n> I don't understand what you mean by “cloning the folder”.\n\nif you go on the folder datas of zeronet there are a lot of website is it possible to clone from here",

The best way to deal with the problem either way is by bookmarking urls.\n> On ZN, we have a slight advantage, though. If you've already visited a site, you can browse it easily. If a new 'fake' site is made and you are lead there by a link, It'll need to find peers and download. Hopefully, You'll be thinking 'wait a sec, I already downloaded this site!' and be suspicious.\n\ni now but in ZeroNet is more simple",
