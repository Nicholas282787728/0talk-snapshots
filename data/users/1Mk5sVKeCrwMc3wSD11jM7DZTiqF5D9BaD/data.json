This is exactly what I always wanted a decentralized platform to be. It's even better because I never even thought about the idea of being able to clone a site you like with two clicks and make it your own, which makes \"installing\" a blog or forum software trivially easy. That's a killer feature.\n\nAnd last but not least, you also don't run into the issue that older decentralized platforms have, where you can't control what content you store and serve to other peers, which used to be among the biggest critiques of decentralized networks. You only serve the sites you visit, so with ZeroNet there are no moral issues in using this software, you don't help distribute illegal content if you don't want to.\n\nI could really see this taking off and becoming huge over the next few years. I'm honestly surprised that it hasn't already gotten much more people interested. Sure, there are still rough edges, but it's already so usable and easy to set up.",

So by now, the people who were waiting for Tor support would have caught up :)\n\nAlthough the improved Tor support is more recent, as far as I understand it, the only difference is that you can now also publish your own sites via Tor, which you weren't able to do before (I think).",

It's also faster, more secure (MITM proof) and eliminates NAT drawbacks.\n\nThanks for the explanation! I didn't notice it being faster, because it was already so fast ;) Even the initial download of sites was really quick for me over Tor, after that it's of course fast because everything is saved locally and only updates are downloaded. But it also feels fast I believe because of all of the nice little animations, distracting from the waiting time :) Really well done.",

				"body": "It is a chicken and egg dilemma in my opinion. Getting people to try out something is relatively easy, especially today where everyone can upload a video explaining a product to the internet and spread it on social media. Getting people to stay however is way harder. The problem is, a really big chunk of people do not come back if they check something out and it isn't working for them yet, if it's boring to them. And on social media, a bad experience can spread fast and wide.\n\nRight now there is very little content, things you can actually spend a lot of time on. I think if people regularly talked here about all kinds of things not just ZeroNet, it would help a lot with this when new people come to check ZeroNet out. The news feeds are a great conversation starter. While this forum specifically might want to stay about ZeroNet only (easier to deal with support that way), another official forum should be made where there are areas for all kind of different topics, gaming, sports, books, movies and TV, etc. And then pull in news feeds from these topics to start conversations, get people to comment on articles.\n\nI think this would help a lot to get things started. And yeah, then get the community together to make a great video that has potential to become viral and post that on Twitter & co (easier said than done of course). Although the right timing is important here. Is ZeroNet already easy enough to install and use for the average joe on Windows right now? I know it isn't on Linux, it was easy for me but I wouldn't trust my parents to be able to do it ;)",

I've already found that it is based on blockchain, and you have to run wallet and spend some coins in order to upload content inside it.\n\nLooks like all data is stored on the blockchain, including html, css, images, everything and you can only upload static websites. The dynamic websites (like the blog) are only from the Qora creators,  not created by users, but everyone can make his own blog, just not anything else other than a blog. At least I think that is the case, the documentation is all over the place and hard to find all of it. It seems they are working on an \"Asset API\" which I guess could be used to make websites dynamic, although someone has to pay for uploading these assets to the blockchain, so either you or your website's users would have to pay money to use your site.\n\nSo, I'd say it's an interesting project but not nearly as interesting as ZeroNet.",

Tried installing namecoin and ethereum couple of days ago. The blockchains are taking so long to sync and use up so much resources... It just doesn't scale. And when you let only companies and organizations host the full blockchain and you use a \"light wallet\" or some web service instead, it's no longer fully decentralized, it's basically federated, and much less interesting.\n\nThat's what happened to email. It used to be decentralized, everyone could run his own mail server on his computer, now it's federated (from what I've read, running your own email server today is asking for lots of trouble because the big email providers just auto flag your mail as spam if it's from an unknown server) and really it's getting close to centralized since so many people use GMail.",

Those are much better options than storing files on the blockchain directly. With Sia and Storj you still have a blockchain to deal with though, so the problem of the blockchain getting too big to deal with for private users is still an issue.\n\nIPFS is much better there from what I've seen, awesome technology, like ZeroNet you decide what you download and upload, but they put the community and the IPFS gateways under a code of conduct so it's not everyone's cup of tea, makes me very wary of it.

The client would just create a tarball of a site in a backup folder before a site is updated (excluding user files so that things like voting and commenting don't create a new site version), then check with other peers who have also done this, they would sign the tarball saying yup I've created the same tarball here. Then this could be integrated in the ZeroNet sidebar, one click to go back to the previous version (or select from a list of all versions). Binary diffing could also be used to only save the differences between the last time the site was backed up, so that the size of the site history doesn't get too big. Going back to a different version would then create a clone of the site at a different address which you then could share with other people on ZeroTalk and co, because nobody should be able to take someones site over, even if the site owner does something nefarious, and even if there was a consensus to go back to the old version (IMHO). And I guess these history/backup files should be optional files to download, so if you want a site's history you would just check it in the ZeroNet sidebar like you can do with optional files.",

Basically (as I understand it, so I might be incorrect), you can create a name that points to a resource, lets say the JSON file data.json which is used as a database in ZeroNet. This name (data.json) points to a hash of the data.json file, a version of that file at a specific point in time. This hash will always point to the same file, if it's changed, the hash still points to the old version and a new hash points to the new version, which is why sites in IPFS are static.\n\nTo make it dynamic, this same name using IPNS can be used to point to the hash of the new, changed data.json file, so when I request the resource behind the name data.json I will always receive the newest version of the data.json file, with new comments added, new votes, whatever it is that is stored in there.\n\nBut I still agree with you that ZeroNet is the most interesting of all of these projects. Like I said earlier in this thread, since IPFS's creators are pro-censorship, it's not everyone's cup of tea. To me it seems like it is mainly targeted at companies who want to save money distributing content rather than creating an internet free of censorship.\n\nZeroNet is the only option (I know of) if you want both a modern take on decentralization and the freedom to share and debate ideas, and it's IMHO a great option. Really have to applaud ZeroNet's developer here, he is so active. Truly inspiring what he has been able to do in such a relatively short period of time and how much work he puts into both the project itself and answering questions from the community.\n\n> [dividedby0](#comment_28_16iYwD5U2fNoS22p6447J7992iL3DHjSHY): No, not all encryption will be broken, just a lot of it. For example NTRU encryption is resistant to quantum computing attacks, and so are One Time Pads. NSA is planning on transitioning to using encryption that will work in a post-quantum computing world, but others say that a quantum computer with that kind of ability will not become available any time soon. Though, it isn't a bad idea to switch to better encryption anyways, whether or not we see the rise of quantum computing any time soon or not.\n\nInteresting, thanks for pointing that out! :)",

But back to your example. What if I make a disrespectful joke? A rude joke? An offensive joke? Maybe even, I hesitate to say it, a sexually inappropriate joke (sharp intake of breaths everywhere)? This Code of Conduct forbids that because it makes no distinction there, it says don't be \"offensive\" or else, no matter your intention, no matter if you were attacking someone or he just felt attacked. Basically, 99.99% of all comedy is forbidden. I don't find that reasonable at all. I like comedy, I enjoy laughing.\n\nBut that is besides the point, I am not going to discuss here if Code of Conducts are a good idea. Some people like them, they are free to use them, I have said twice in this thread they are not everyone's cup of tea, my exact words, not that they are devil spawn. I however will not use them, I don't exclude people on such a grand scale. I, and I hope and believe most people, at the very least in western societies, are more tolerant than that.\n\nI will however call it what it is when it's applied to a whole network: Censorship. When you apply this Code of Conduct to a network, a purpose that such a document was never meant for, it is applied to all content shared over that network. We aren't just talking about jokes here anymore, now we are talking about \"offensive\" pictures, music, movies, books, just everything. Again, this is censorship. And I do not support censorship. Censorship leads to terrible things, it leads to great suffering. I grew up in a country with a long history of censorship that continues to this day and is even getting worse. Censorship is anti intellectual. One of the reasons I am using decentralized networks is to get away from censorship. You might be using decentralized networks for a different purpose and that is totally fine, to each his own, I have no problem with that.\n\nAs for their IPFS gateways, yes, they should have rules for that in place, if I was in their shoes I would not want to host content that is illegal in my or the server's country for example or could disrupt the service, like tons of spam or maliciously wasting resources. Usually, and this is standard practice, that's what you use a Terms of Service agreement for, an actual legal document. Not a Code of Conduct that is too ambiguous to ever hold up in court, so is effectively useless for that purpose.",

				"body": "Did you check out the two tutorials? The second one deals with the database. You can find them in the sidebar of ZeroBlog.\n\nIt basically works like o4zw5vmpoz5hz78z says, but the json file every user has is the content.json file. That file tells ZeroNet about all of the user's files, it doesn't hold the actual data from users that gets put into the database, it links to such a data file instead. It's basically the same as the root level content.json file of a ZeroNet site. That file is what gets downloaded by other peers to find out what other files need to be downloaded.\n\nAnd it also includes information about the user, like his ZeroID. So you don't actually need to save into the database \"this post was created by ekaterina@zeroid.bit\" because that can just be reconstructed based on the user's content.json file. The second tutorial shows how. The SQL for that looks very complex, that put me off at first, but it's actually easy once you understand all the SQL commands used in the tutorial.\n\nAnd how the database is constructed from the json data file is something you tell ZeroNet through the use of a dbschema.json file. You tell it how to map nodes in the json to tables in the database. That part is really easy. And ZeroNet then merges all the data from all the users into one database. So if I have a user profile in my json, to use your example, ZeroNet converts this into a single row in the Profiles table (or however you want to call it). Every user's profile becomes a row. That also solves by design the two problems you mentioned, having database entries that anyone can write in and only a certain user can write in.\n\nBut yeah since this is decentralized, you need to think a bit differently about things and might have to come up with tricks to solve a problem. You often need a unique ID for table rows for example, like a unique post id so that you can link other table's rows (like comments or votes) to posts, but you can't just create a number on the server that is increased by one every time a new post is created because there is no server, every user is a server. So instead each user gets his own number that is increased by one every time and then you combine that with the user's identity address (which is also the name of the user's data folder) to make that id unique. For example, let's say my identity address is md393939dmmf39. If I create a new post, it's unique ID would become 1-md393939dmmf39. My second post would be 2-md393939dmmf39, and so on. Other users will use the same numbers starting from one, but there identity address will be different, that one is unique. Check out the source of ZeroTalk, ZeroBlog and so on on Github, it's quite easy to follow and it'll teach you all of that.",

Either way i keep reading and learning and maybe someday i ll make my own or someone can save me and get a framework working :)\n\nYou really don't need to learn a lot to start developing sites for ZeroNet, I would be surprised if any web dev needs more than a few hours to get started. Reading and writing files in ZeroNet is literally one line of code each, then another for publishing the file to other peers. User login is also one line of code and ZeroNet takes care of the rest, that is usually quite hard in web development IMHO (oAuth, it's like magnets, how do they work???) and in ZeroNet it's trivially easy.\n\nI am not that experienced at web dev (only been doing it as a hobby for a few years) and I made these two ZeroNet sites just fine: [ZeroTodos](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1B8LmXYHzMGZzcRWoidAQb5SmKSyfjN63f) and [ZeroQuotes](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NJyPoPpL8At17T6G7A1qHVQdqZDBmXcLT). The latter is basically 90% what you learn in the tutorial, I made it while following the tutorial closely and just changed a few small things to turn the chat into something else.\n\nBut you do of course need to know how to develop websites, you can't expect to be able to program without learning how to program first. A framework won't help you there, it makes some tasks easier (and some harder) but it's still programming, it just makes programming more convenient, less tedious.

You only own them for a year, if you don't renew it (because you forgot to or abandon ZeroNet) the link to your site will stop working.

No more domain names.\n\nThat's a pretty low risk though since Namecoin is decentralized too and it has been one of the most popular crypto currency coins for many years. If there are only 10 people left using it, Namecoin will still work. If ZeroNet were to integrate domain registration, it would need a transaction history so it would need it's own blockchain and I'm not a fan of that. Blockchains get way too big too fast, in a year it would already take hours to install ZeroNet and then days, which would seriously hinder adoption. The other option would be a central server for domains which is of course not a good solution since then you are beholden to a central authority.

This way, if a ZeroNet site you visit requests a resource from the normal internet outside of ZeroNet (because the site creator didn't know any better or is malicious), your IP isn't leaked. Unless you use a VPN that masks your whole internet traffic, then of course your VPN provider's IP would be leaked, not your own.\n\nIt is also possible to run your browser in a virtual machine without internet access while you have the ZeroNet client running on your host OS with internet access. That is probably the most secure, even potential security exploits can't cause any harm then since there is no internet, only the ZeroNet API that can talk to the Host OS to download/upload using ZeroNet only. It's always a tradeoff between convenience and security, you need to decide for yourself how big your threat model is so how elaborate your security needs to be, I'm sure there are even more insane lengths you can go to to make it even more secure :)\n\nIf you do decide to use Tor Browser (I started out using Chrome and then switched myself), you need to configure it once to allow direct access to your local host to make it work with ZeroNet.

Lawyers can give you an opinion on that, a supreme court would have to decide for sure.\n\nDecentralization is only now getting really popular, so there haven't been many court cases yet. I do know a German lawyer looked at I2P for example and said it's fine legally but there were one or two concerning related court cases where the judge has (in the lawyer's opinion) ruled wrongly.\n\nAnd of course decentralized networks in General and ZeroNet in particular are tiny, begs the question if there is even any real interest to go after people on these when there are tons of much bigger and easier targets.\n\nBut that's why you have to decide for yourself, nobody can really tell you for sure. There is always a risk and if you can't live with that risk, take more security measures to lower the risk. ZeroNet's dev said about 40% of peers use Tor at the moment (that was before the Torrentfreak article and the huge amount of new users), which means that 60% of people don't use any security measures at all, to them the risk is too low to care.

I assume most people who want to use a decentralized network do so because they want to get rid of censorship. I hope they change their stance at some point, but for now it's uninteresting to me.\n\nThe first public test version of MaidSafe comes out this month I think, we'll have to see if it is better than ZeroNet, it's been in development for a decade and was often decried as vaporware because of that, but I will try it out for sure, I crowdfunded it. Freenet I don't like, you can't choose what content you seed, could be all kinds of illegal data going through your internet connection.

Every website has it's source available, that's just how websites work (right click, view page source), that doesn't mean the Google website or the Microsoft website for example is open source and can be freely shared and modified by everyone.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, of course it would be better if everything was open source and freely cloneable (where it makes sense), but open source is a niche, forcing it on people would hinder ZeroNet's mainstream adoption.",

Exactly what info are users forced to leak?\n> Precisely which sql commands can be be used to create a profile of users and exactly what info can be extrapolated?\n> 'Powerful admins' could potentially be a problem, therefore designing a 'trustless' system should be the priority rather than just reinventing the wheel and creating even more all powerful admins that may not be entirely trustworthy.\n\nA ZeroNet site cannot be censored by a third party, you can create a blog and write whatever you please, no company and no government can bring your blog down. However, the owner of a site can do whatever he wants. That means the owner of a site can censor. That means the owner can send information outside of ZeroNet to the clearnet, and yes ZeroID right now doesn't work without doing that, the Source Code for all official ZeroNet sites is open source, including ZeroID, take a look to see exactly what it does: https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroID\n\nTo find out more how ZeroNet sites in general work I'd also recommend going through the ZeroNet site development tutorial part 1 and 2 that are linked on the official ZeroBlog in the sidebar. Then you understand why things work the way they do. If you are not a developer and can't go through the source yourself, I can only say there is nothing nefarious going on as far as I can see, there are technical reasons behind this.\n\nUsername registration (ZeroID), domain registration (ZeroName) and things like it where you need some kind of ledger were traditionally something where you needed a central service, otherwise everyone could register the same username or steal someone's username. ZeroID connects to an open source PHP script on a server to handle this if I am not mistaken (while I've read a lot of the official ZeroNet sites' source code, ZeroID I have looked at the least).\n\nThere are now decentralized alternatives to deal with this issue, some already usable others still in development, you can use the Bitcoin blockchain technology for example, that's what Namecoin does for domain registration, you can use Ethereum which is being specifically created to add this (and other types of smart contracts as they are called) functionality on top of other decentralized networks like ZeroNet.\n\nHowever, blockchain systems have a huge drawback. Blockchains don't scale. They just don't. Ethereum's takes a day to download already and it's not even released yet, it's still in development, it's all in a beta/alpha state. Namecoin also takes 20 hours or so depending on the speed of your harddrive among others. If ZeroNet were to use a blockchain, surely nobody would use it but for a very small niche of people, it would never grow, you can't make the mainstream wait a day (and as time passes days, then weeks and so on) before they can ever open and use their first website. But if you still want to, you can use blockchains with ZeroNet. ZeroName for example, that is also a centralized service by default (doesn't connect to the clearnet though I believe). But there is a plugin you can enable for ZeroNet (look in your ZeroNet Plugins folder) to use your own Namecoin node which has downloaded the huge Namecoin blockchain so you don't need to rely on / trust the ZeroName site, it's just the default because blockchains are huge and it makes everything so much harder. Maybe something like that will be possible for ZeroID too. If not, you have the option to use a different ID provider like ZeroVerse and hopefully soon even more as more people create their own to make this less centralized.\n\nAs for the censorship, yes, that is not optimal, that is something I still don't like 100% either. But there is no right answer here, there are always up and downsides to every solution. ZeroNet's idea of stopping censorship by site owners is giving people the ability to clone sites if a site admin misbehaves. Not all sites are cloneable, the site owner decides if you can clone it, but users should therefore prefer to use sites that are cloneable if they don't want to get locked in to a site that could end up censoring.\n\nAlso please keep in mind ZeroNet is version 0.36. The project is only a little over a year old and made by one person. Don't expect a perfect system this early in the life of the project. It is improving all the time and I'm sure these things will also be improved if they can be improved without sacrificing too much (like a blockchain would).\n\nOh and about the ZeroPolls SQL query, since I created ZeroPolls, just look at the ZeroPolls.coffee source code in your ZeroNet folder, I distribute it with all my sites. The SQL query I use actually does fetch the usernames, it just doesn't display them. There is nothing that can be done about this, this is just how ZeroNet sites work since they are decentralized, every user has all the data, there is no hidden data. So Erkan's ZeroVerse and making a throwaway account solves this issue, votes are tied to your id and someone could find out what that ID voted on, but if you use ZeroVerse as a throwaway id you don't need to care about that.",

When I find the time I will modify it to run on ZeroNet, could take a month or two though, I've already got too much work on my hands with my current ZeroNet sites :)",

Currently to share your site to other devices I have to copy the link to some place like google keep and then open it on other machines through the same g.keep, but if there was some blog.ekaterina.bit, I would just enter the address =) very comfortable!\n\nI generally prefer the hash links, I only use a .bit domain for ZeroPolls because it makes the URL shorter and the links to polls are sharable so this makes it look nicer. The long hash links however are better because they will work forever, whereas a .bit domain is only registered for about 6 months (depends on block creation speed so it's not a precise amount of time). If the owner of the domain forgets to renew it (or doesn't use ZeroNet anymore) all links would stop working and might even direct to a malicious site instead if someone else grabs the domain.\n\nThere are other reasons why hash links are better but this is the big one. But the domains only cost 2 cent, so I'll buy some when I get the chance to make it easier for people who really want that, but my harrdrive is dying right now so I'd better not play around with the huge namecoin blockchain before I fixed that :) Sadly someone already owns the ekaterina.bit domain, that would have been nice :) Then I could just use subdomains like blog.ekaterina.bit instead of buying a bunch of domains for every site.",
