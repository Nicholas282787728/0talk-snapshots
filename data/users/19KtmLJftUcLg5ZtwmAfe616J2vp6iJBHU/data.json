For a market we need a lot of people and a complex system for escrowing antispamming antiscamming rating ! Also who will take responsibility for creating an official market that people will buy/sell drugs too or it will have some kind of censorship?\n\nNobody. Thats whats great about this platform. If I create a market platform and release it on here I am not liable for what is done with it. I am not hosting it, or allowing it to run. There is no one to hold liable for creating such a platform.",

				"body": "Ugh, its so trivial. I do not think there is a right answer, its speculative. If I create and upload a market platform with no visible intent for illegal use, can I still get in trouble? All I did was create a market source code, I do not host or maintain it. I just threw it out and let people do what they want with it. You cannot be prosecuted. Especially if the owner \"throws away\" the key to edit the site. Now, you could say that those hosting are responsible, but that's not realistically prosecutable. As I said, I think this is so out-there we will have to wait and see what happens.. I hope the platform catches on, though.  [noiamo](#comment_19_14XxpXNGMLsyeQxikacrbQnAFXVyhN5Ngx): Agreed",
