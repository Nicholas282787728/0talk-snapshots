			"body": "How can end users combat spam and \"undesirable content\" besides not seeding content? 0chan is getting spammed with some of that and it seems like the same that events that went down on freenet back in the day are repeating themselves on zeronet. Pedos start sharing their content (I personally don't care as long as I don't have to seed it), a rabble starts rousing about pedos and the network slowly dies into irrelevance. \"Undesirable content\" is an obvious inevitability in any censor resistant environment and I don't think it's something you can fully mitigate. In my experience pedos will do what they do regardless of the law, if they keep to their corner and are ignored their presence is minimized. Instead of scapegoating the pedos how can the community start combating spammers and people who don't respect boundaries?",
