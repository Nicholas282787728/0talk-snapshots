It's fast, supports dynamic content, supports anonymity through Tor, and already has lots of great sample apps. This is exactly what I always wanted a decentralized platform to be. It's even better because I never even thought about the idea of being able to clone a site you like with two clicks and make it your own, which makes \"installing\" a blog or forum software trivially easy. That's a killer feature.\n> And last but not least, you also don't run into the issue that older decentralized platforms have, where you can't control what content you store and serve to other peers, which used to be among the biggest critiques of decentralized networks. You only serve the sites you visit, so with ZeroNet there are no moral issues in using this software, you don't help distribute illegal content if you don't want to.\n> I could really see this taking off and becoming huge over the next few years. I'm honestly surprised that it hasn't already gotten much more people interested. Sure, there are still rough edges, but it's already so usable and easy to set up.\n\nI think it'll get a lot more popular with Tor support",

Basically (as I understand it, so I might be incorrect), you can create a name that points to a resource, lets say the JSON file data.json which is used as a database in ZeroNet. This name (data.json) points to a hash of the data.json file, a version of that file at a specific point in time. This hash will always point to the same file, if it's changed, the hash still points to the old version and a new hash points to the new version, which is why sites in IPFS are static.\n> To make it dynamic, this same name using IPNS can be used to point to the hash of the new, changed data.json file, so when I request the resource behind the name data.json I will always receive the newest version of the data.json file, with new comments added, new votes, whatever it is that is stored in there.\n> But I still agree with you that ZeroNet is the most interesting of all of these projects. Like I said earlier in this thread, since IPFS's creators are pro-censorship, it's not everyone's cup of tea. To me it seems like it is mainly targeted at companies who want to save money distributing content rather than creating an internet free of censorship.\n> ZeroNet is the only option (I know of) if you want both a modern take on decentralization and the freedom to share and debate ideas, and it's IMHO a great option. Really have to applaud ZeroNet's developer here, he is so active. Truly inspiring what he has been able to do in such a relatively short period of time and how much work he puts into both the project itself and answering questions from the community.\n> \n> Interesting, thanks for pointing that out! :)\n\nHow are they pro-censorship? i haven't heard of it",
