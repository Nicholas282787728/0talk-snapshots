			"title": "(politics) The Young Turks hosting Project Wolf-PAC",
			"body": "Our Ultimate Goal:\n\n\nTo restore true, representative democracy in the United States by pressuring our State Legislators to pass a much needed Free and Fair Elections Amendment to our Constitution. There are only 2 ways to amend the Constitution: (1) Go through our Federal Government  (2) Go through our State Legislators via a national convention. \n\nWolf PAC believes that we can no longer count on our Federal Government to do what is in the best interest of the American people due to the unfettered amount of money they receive from outside organizations to fund their campaigns. We point to the failure of the Disclose Act as rock solid evidence that this would be a total waste of our time, effort, and money. We also point to the recent decision by the US Supreme Court to not even hear a case filed by Montana claiming it did not have to abide by Citizens United, as proof that state legislation is not a sufficient measure to solve this problem.  We believe that we have no choice but to put an amendment in the hands of our State Legislators, who are not, at this moment in time, completely blinded by the influence of money, and might actually do what 96% of the country wants - take away the massive influence that money has over our political process.  \n\n(Join the fight to get money out of politics)\n\n- Project Wolf-PAC: http://www.wolf-pac.com/\n- TYT Network Homepage: https://www.tytnetwork.com/\n- The Young Turks - Live Main Show: https://youtu.be/8uVpG3frhJ8",
