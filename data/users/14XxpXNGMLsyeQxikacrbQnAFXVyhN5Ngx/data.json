I just threw it out and let people do what they want with it. You cannot be prosecuted. Especially if the owner \"throws away\" the key to edit the site. Now, you could say that those hosting are responsible, but that's not realistically prosecutable. As I said, I think this is so out-there we will have to wait and see what happens..
