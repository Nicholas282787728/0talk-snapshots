In this case, from a termianl window, I am able to download and launch Zeronet on the device. My Internet browser can connect to 127.0.0.1:43110 and I am able to create a Zeromail account... ;)\n\nDoesn't that kill your battery really quickly though?",

However, for whatever reason I was able to increase the speeds tremendously by setting a proxy on my torrent client. I have no idea how that works, but it does. \nTorrent client usually doesn't matter much in how anonymous your downloads are though.",
