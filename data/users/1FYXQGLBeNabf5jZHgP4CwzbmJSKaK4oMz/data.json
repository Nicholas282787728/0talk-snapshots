Now a guy downloads this site from me. What happens if they click on video #6 which I don't have a copy of? I don't know exactly, but as I said in the previous paragraph, I doubt I could have all or even most of your video files that are > 1 MB in size - it's simply impossible. \n\n (I think the project leader said (ZN on Github) he'll change the way downloads work so that each file that belongs to a site is downloaded from a different source)",

I think the developers already did a good job already though. \n\nIt's very hard to make things secure, even with Tor. Anyone who wants very good security should not run ZeroNet on a non-secure device such as your regular computer. ZN+Tor is the 2nd best choice and I think the Windows bundle does that. \n \nSecure deletion: I am not entirely convinced. If you simply don't click on random crap, you won't end up with unwanted content on your computer. If you think what is preferable - not download unwanted content, or being able to wipe unwanted content. I'd say the former is more important and it'd be better if we worked towards some sort of reputation system that can be used to lower the likelihood of unwanted downloads as well as to prevent spam and many other things. Even if you delete some unwanted content, if you left traces (IP address at the telco, ZeroNet log on your PC, etc.), securely deleting the content won't help you in most jurisdictions. \nLike with Tor, the only reasonable way is to use a secure OS (e.g. Tails) and not persist anything at all. And most users can't be bothered to do that.\n\n`user.deleteSiteData` (or whatever is used to delete a site) could contain a call to the shred command, but on Windows it seems there's no equivalent (maybe a CoreUtils binary could be added to ZN bundle?).",

I'm not saying I disagree with you, but what solutions would there be to stop ZeroNet turning into this?\n\nNotice that I am not arguing against free peer-assisted hosting on ZN - as I said I do it now. \nThe difference is that for some content there won't be enough (or any) free seeders. \n\n@nofish says if one has valuable content, he won't have problems. Yes, so free may work for those. But there are always others who would like to pay. It's a choice thing. If someone wants to pay (or wants to seed for money), why not let them? \nIt's not like noone would seed a site for free because some other guy is already seeding it for 5000 satoshi/day. You said it yourself (if the content is good, it will be seeded for free).\n\nThere are several important cases where only paid seeding can work:\na) When the poster can't be online all the time. Say the publisher doesn't own a computer or can't afford to pay for this cloud service, but can pay 0.001 BTC to service that strives to be online 24x7\nb) When the poster has content that requires a lot of resources (capacity, bandwidth, etc.)\nc) When any sort of \"customization\" is important. Say I am from Burundi, I publish only in local language, so I want to ensure at least one seeder outside of Burundi always has a copy of my latest content\n\nI could probably come up with more use cases, but the main point is that it's not really important what would people do. As long as there's a convenient way to do it (pay the seeders), good paid services *that ZeroNet users want* would thrive. \n\nWe shouldn't be worried about people monetizing ZN (at least I wouldn't, since I only gain to stand if *in addition* to existing free services I could also pay a bit to get even more amazing paid services).\n\n@nofish:\n\n> This service provider gives you a full machine access and you can run any kind of applications on it.\n\nIn case of any \"illegal\" content, the provider is screwed, and the customer (ZN user) is screwed too unless he uses some very anonymous way to pay for this service and connect to it. So this is a good choice for some, but it has its risks for many others.\nFrom a decentralization perspective, if something can be done efficiently in a decentralized way, why not provide a way to do it? (For example at the moment I can seed any ZN site and do it in a more private and cheaper way than any hosting company, but I don't know how the publisher can know that I am delivering on my promise to seed his site. In other words, how can some 1abcd...4565 site know that \"testingzeronet12\" is one of this mirrors and perhaps check his uptime.)",

Does ZeroNet work on Raspberry Pi?\n> In addition to being power-saving, installing ZeroNet on a Raspberry Pi and using it as a seedbox means it can also be portable, ie, you can just seed from a free Wifi hotspot, as long as there is a power-bank attached to it and you SSH'ed into the Raspberry Pi earlier. This would provide a cheap, anonymous and cost-effective way to seed websites and videos.\n\nYou're not solving his problem. He wants people to seed tons of content for free. \n\nRunning on Pi or any small device isn't a solution (how many GB can you seed and how well from an overloaded (free) WiFi hotspot).
