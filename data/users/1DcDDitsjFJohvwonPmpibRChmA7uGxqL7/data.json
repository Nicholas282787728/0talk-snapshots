I imagine a script that would keep deleting the data/*/data/users/17i7Y7r8nTaCfLbCAuaKyc4R5BbKZYU2Hr/ folder (my user's folder). This would probably remove that user from your feed. The problem is that (I think) zeronet would keep downloading it. Not sure how that can be fixed without a built-in solution.\n\nI don't speak coffeescript (well I did years ago, but not any more) nor do I know the ZeroTalk schema, but js/TopicList.coffee has a function called loadTopics which has the query to list the topics available to you to view.  It'd simply be a matter of keeping per-user blacklists and using them in the topic query",

But this could result in a single point of failure, as soon as the owners of the hosters clear their zites, this would affect a lot other. On the other hand you maybe could have a central imagehoster who is capable of uploading images to your own zite and later linking to it would be rather cool. This on the other hand could result in freenet-like behavior, where freesites include images of others just to keep them alive. You would need to block zites intentionally.\n\nThink \"decentralized\" host instead... having the originator of the image be able to delete is a feature, not a bug...  What I'm thinking is something like a curated site of content contributed by users, where the curators decides whose content to show, and the host deciding what to share.",

You can use an img tag, which is native HTML, and then put a link in there to a site, or something like ipfs.
