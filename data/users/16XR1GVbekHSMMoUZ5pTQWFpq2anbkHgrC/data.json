You can also slide the 'home button' in the top right to open a sidebar that has some info on how many people you're connected to, and the geo-info you're getting.\n\nYeah, it displays only current usage though. I was wondering if someone would be aggregating these with time and posting the evolution on some website.",

I'd say if this is something you're interested in, you should make something like it yourself.\n\nYeah, sounds like a nice side project. Just want to check before reinventing the wheel.",

What it will include and measure?\n\nI most interested in the number of peers at a given time (various resolutions), but it would apply to any other measurable attributes. I guess this would inherently be a per-website metric, and I'm wondering if aggregating these would give insights into global ZeroNet usage with time.",
