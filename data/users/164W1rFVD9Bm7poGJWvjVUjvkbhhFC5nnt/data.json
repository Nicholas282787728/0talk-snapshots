			"title": "How to Bypass ZeroTorrent or ZeroTalk quotas by creating new user accounts",
			"body": "The MultiUser plugin offers the function to create new user ID and ZeroID accounts and bypass the quota limit. To enable it, rename `ZeroNet/plugins/disabled-Multiuser` to `ZeroNet/plugins/Multiuser` then restart ZeroNet. And you can disable again renaming the folder to disabled-Multiuser and restarting ZN.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##How to change users in Multiuser plugin\n\nYou can change your account by clicking in the `user ID` button, up in the [New ZeroHello home](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/) on the top right (the fourth from the right). And you press `logout.`\n\nThen you can login by clicking again in that button and you must provide your `master seed`. Thats your new profile, which can be whatever you want.\n\n- Thanks to [Talnicron](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/1RedkCkVaXuVXrqCMpoXQS29bwaqsuFdL/19M1DT5vruSATEcbEczYRwCk2uPuLcATBa/talnicrom@zeroid.bit) for bringing this up and [Riotpulv](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/1RedkCkVaXuVXrqCMpoXQS29bwaqsuFdL/1EZG8eDkCFvNkYxpHmr2WbGWcSxAsRfqTT/riotpulv@zeroid.bit) for further info. \n\n\n***\n#Alternative #1\n\nYou can also change users manually without the plugin. Reference in [ZeroDocs](http://127.0.0.1:43110/17Kom2G5qNDc6NaQwv445h1gFzxkY3ZtZe/faq/?wrapper_nonce=702f77904c629c1e97ab52922bf7abc17e3c093a075fb9604735a06e8e1e5907#can-i-use-the-same-username-on-multiple-machine) (If you know the developers ask them for more details and to include instructions about the plugin).\n\nCopy the `ZeroBundle/ZeroNet/data/users.json` file in your ZN program folder to another folder. Erase the file and restart ZN. You can restore your first user by copying the new file to another folder and overwriting it by the first `users.json` file.\n\n***\n#Alternative #2\n\nUse these proxies, open them in your browser while ZN is running:\n\n1. https://proxy1.zn.kindlyfire.me\n\n2. http://wrewolf.com:43110\n\n3. https://bit.no.com:43110\n\n4. https://zero.acelewis.com/#ZeroNetwork.bit\n\n***\n#Alternative #3\n\nYou can edit `user.json` in your data folder and change the firsts lines:\n\n    \"certs\": {\n    \"zeroid.bit\": {\n    \"auth_address\": \"1...\",\n    \"auth_privatekey\": \"5...\",\n    \"auth_type\": \"web\",\n    \"auth_user_name\": \"username\",\n    \"cert_sign\": \"...\"\n    }\n    }\n\nPlease save you old `\"zeroid.bit\": { [...] }` in a safe place: it is your old identity. Also save the entry about ZeroID which contains the string `1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz`.\n\nYou need to delete this line `\"certs\": { [...] }` and replace with `\"certs\": {}`. You also need to delete the ZeroID entry. When you restart ZN then you can create a new ZeroID identity and switch between the multiple ones changing the `\"zeroid.bit\": { [...] }` on the `user.json` file.\n\n* Thanks [zeropunto](http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:7_19sggoAZ4hcorrrfWoFWP9rwfpVsL29cnZ#comment_6_1wnjTS6YRUp6Q6yjECuoh1o28TPkvrnq2) for this alternative method. And [kensan](#comment_47_1LUP6SN7WrXAH7e5bUFxdmrVsFr2m43XB4) for more details.\n\nPlease report if you try any of these methods so we can improve the guide.",

Your idea about basic human requirements doesn't solve that, it is just a way for you to make good wishes.\n\nBe sincere, how much of this is because you were raised by your family to feel entitled to modern conveniences such as electricity and water supply? Billions of people in the world don't have these conveniences because there are no trained and skillful workers and entrepreneurs to provide them. Either criminals or the government would take away their compensation, or there is just not enough compensation.\n\n[Look up Anarcho-capitalism](http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe5.html) to solve this challenge in a way that produces the most social peace, goods and services the most cheaply and most reliably.",
