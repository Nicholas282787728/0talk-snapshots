In other words, Zeronet has a lot of hidden circumvention servers. Block all the Zeronet servers will be a big cost for GFW.",

But it seems can be improved in the future.\n\nBelow is @nofish's comment on reddit:\n==============================================\nEvery P2P network requires an initial node to get IP addresses (for example Bitcoin using this hard-coded ones), so you can't get around of this, but later it can be improved (for example adding more tor/i2p bootstrap nodes)",
