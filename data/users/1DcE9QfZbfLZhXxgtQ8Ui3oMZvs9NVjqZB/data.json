In addition, it could prove the most useful blogging platform, since each user becomes a server, making any slightly popular site impossible to take down.\n\nPrivacy apps will have to be built atop Zeronet, and it can be done. \n\nI just looked at the script. It's very simple. It calls http://l2.io/ip.js?var=myip, which is just an external site that responds with your IP address. So all it's doing is accessing an external site.\n\nBut fixing that problem isn't enough, because malicious javascript could cause deanonymization anyway. It's a somewhat routine event. Every few years there's a zero day discovered where javascript deanonymizes users. So I guess you could turn off scripts and try to get your browser to not load content that's not through the zeronet local proxy. But I wouldn't trust the browser to do either reliably.",
