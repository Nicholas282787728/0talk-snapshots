In ZeroHello, some sites' menu display the \"clone\" entry, others don't. What's the rationale, here?\n2) Is there a way to change the way a cloned site looks on ZeroHello? Its name/description, basically?\n\nThanks guys.",

			"body": "Hey guys.\n\nJust wondering, is it possible (and if so, how) to call Zeroframe commands from non-coffeescript code? For instance, I'm trying to get some JSON files from my ZeroSite. On a non-Zero version of it, I just $.getJSON() it, but CORS prevents me to do it on ZeroNet, right? Anyway, I thought of using fileGet instead, but I can't get it to work without CoffeeScript...\n\nThanks :)",
