The problem is really only solvable by relying on the community to police itself, because it is a fundamentally unwinnable technical battle to make a completely cheat proof game of this type. Play with your friends.\"\n\nThe P2P part is actually a red herring, though. Sure, you can use some heuristics server-side to try to catch cheaters, but it doesn't really matter that much if scores aren't worth anything and you don't incentivize cheating by making some kind of leaderboard. In fact, cheats could even make a game more fun by giving new ways to play the game, or people could compete by writing bots. Or you could even build a game around writing bots.",

It's just as likely they're passwords and email addresses taken from hacks of other sites. Either way, I would not say everyone with an account on these sites needs to go out and change their password, provided they're already using good password hygiene.\n\nIt's good practice to use a password manager that automatically fills in your password based on URL and enforces HTTPS (or use some other means of enforcing HTTPS like HTTPS everywhere) in order to avoid being phished. If your password manager doesn't automatically fill in a password when you expect, that should be a strong indication that you are being phished and that you should tread very carefully.",
