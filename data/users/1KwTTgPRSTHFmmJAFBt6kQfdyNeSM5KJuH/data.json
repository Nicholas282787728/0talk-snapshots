I'm not suggesting the whole damn project *has* to move away from the two: there would be people to complain about the resulting version then.\n\n\nSo, If *you* were to re-implement ZeroNet, what would your language(s) of choice be, and why?\n\n\nPersonally, I would write all (or some) of it in [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) -- From what I know, It handles concurrency better than JS/Node.\n\nOther languages mentioned will be listed here.",
