BBS, ant then Web 1.0.I think ZeroNet has a lot of potential but it's too early to start bridging with the regular joe. ZeroNet is for a censorship free internet, and allowing people with sensibilities in now could actually hinder that goal.\n\nI agree. The normal web is good enough for \"normals.\" I think ZeroNet should first become rock solid, with a critical mass of early users, and full of interesting content (which is the really important thing). Then, the \"normals\" in search of a better alternative will be able to find it.",
