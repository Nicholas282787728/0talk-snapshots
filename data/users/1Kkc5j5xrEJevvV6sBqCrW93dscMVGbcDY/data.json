Deuche Bank is in trouble too and if it goes down things will be pretty dire. It would probably be a worse crash than Lehman Brothers of 2008. Also there is no wrong in having private property. You seem to shrouded in faulty propaganda. The libertarian policy didn't go so well in Honduras did it?\n\nFirst, I find it quite funny someone who comes with marxism mumbo-jumbo claiming that I'm into faulty propaganda, since Marx didn't predict this and even didn't live by his own words being supported\n by his wife and later by Engels, never working in his whole life. Anyone can predict economic crisis, but Marx never admitted that his claims against capitalism were responsible for them, exactly like Deutsche Bank, exactly like BOJ and exactly like the 2008 USA subprime crises caused by the socialist big government.  \nSecond, I never saw a libertarian claiming Honduras is \"a libertarian paradise\", quite the contrary.\nhttps://mises.ca/since-when-is-honduras-a-libertarian-paradise",

Their intent was always to use Japan to destroy itself and as many other Gentiles as possible, while promising them world conquest.The Central Bank of Japan is controlled by Jews.Today, Japan is used the Jews as a pawn between China, North Korea, Russia and the United States.In 50 years in Japan will be only Jews and African slaves.Leading Jews are doing the same to America and Russia.
