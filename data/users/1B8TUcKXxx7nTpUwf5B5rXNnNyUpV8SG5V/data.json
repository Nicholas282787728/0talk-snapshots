Zeronet is getting its publicity as an anonymous network for torrent sharing which cannot be censored, which means unstoppable piracy! To be accepting of that but not of other kind of criminal activity hypocritical in nature. I am not suggesting you should be accepting of any kind of criminal activity whatsoever. On the other hand, without the popularity of uncensored p2p sharing, the zeronet wouldn't survive long. Its quite the conundrum!",
