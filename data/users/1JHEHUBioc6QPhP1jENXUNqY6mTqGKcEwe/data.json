				"body": "> Please don't make this about restraining Freedom even more.\n\nI can greatly appreciate where you are coming from, and it is a reasonable request within the scope of the conversations that you want to have with people. But myself, and obviously other people by virtue of you even needing to post this message, other people feel differently. Maybe casually, maybe very passionately. \n\nHomophobia is a serious issue with or without the violence, though obviously the issue is different for those looking to stay alive vs those suffering in silence over fear that they might be gay or could become gay (even though it doesn't work like that).\n\nThere will be people that will say this massacre was \"completely\" (or other qualifier) preventable, and many suggestions will be mutually exclusive and tied to an easily identifiable ideology.\n\nEveryone is going to be dealing with it their own way. Some people will go about their day and never even hear about this event.\n\nWhat I think we can do is provide support to our friends and neighbors that are being effected by this, and listen to people to get insight into how other people are experiencing this. But we can also have boundaries; there are going to be opinions we won't want to hear, suggestions or \"insights\" that will in that moment will cause us to deeply hate that person for a moment.\n\nWhat I am going to do: participate in conversations I can learn from, including how this has impacted my friends, neighbors, and others far away. I am going to step away any time I feel I am no longer speaking or listening with a mind open to change.\n\nI wish you the best in finding the place you need to be right now.",
