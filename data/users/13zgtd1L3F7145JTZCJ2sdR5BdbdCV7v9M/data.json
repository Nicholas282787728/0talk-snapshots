It should work that way without you having to open ports.\n\n2) I'm not sure going for one of those sites would be a good idea, since you'd be trusting a third party with your domain, not to mention the fact that you'd be paying more. In my case it didn't take more than a few hours to download the whole blockchain, and the process of exchanging BTC for NMC (via ShapeShift) and registering my domain was pretty painless. I would recommend waiting it out.",

I only recently jumped on the ZeroNet bandwagon after looking something Freenet-related up on Wikipedia, so I'm sure there are other things I'm missing. Thus, if you or anyone else has recently come upon (or started working on) something similarly cool, feel free to mention it here. :)",
