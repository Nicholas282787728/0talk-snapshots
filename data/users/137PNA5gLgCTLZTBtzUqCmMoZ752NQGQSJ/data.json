Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.\n```\n\nI believe this is caused by the urls I have on my css file:\n\n```\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'FontAwesome';\n  src: url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=4.6.3');\n  src: url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?#iefix&v=4.6.3') format('embedded-opentype'), url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2?v=4.6.3') format('woff2'), url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff?v=4.6.3') format('woff'), url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf?v=4.6.3') format('truetype'), url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.svg?v=4.6.3#fontawesomeregular') format('svg');\n  font-weight: normal;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n```\n\nIs there a way to fix this issue and get the fonts to work?",
