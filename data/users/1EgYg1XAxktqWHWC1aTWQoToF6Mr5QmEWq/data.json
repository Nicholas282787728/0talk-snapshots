I just gathered someone deleted it :( . You can still access it by a link, hang on Il try and find it. And yup @bukaking that was my post! No idea what the hell happened to it....\n\nAnd woah yeah, this post has inherited the  comments of the post that disappeared? I broke the Zeronet, what an achievement!!",

This is so bizarre, you can access this same post from the link above and this http://127.0.0.1:43110/Talk.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Topic:1_1EgYg1XAxktqWHWC1aTWQoToF6Mr5QmEWq/Transfered+my+users+json+to+my+laptop+but+can+t+access+my+ZeroMail. Interesting that they both seem to have the same key.\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the fact that both my desktop and my laptop are both online with the ZeroNet right now?\n",
