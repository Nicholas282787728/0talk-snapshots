You can make a websote the usual way and then change the keys to your vanity keys.\n\nIf you are going to use .bit it might just be better to use a brain wallet with a secure passphrase (use warpwallet as it is not viable to bruteforce) as then you can recover the keys if your harddrive fails/is stolen ect. Although the keys should be in a cryptographically secure place e.g. Encrypted harddrive, Truecrypt.",
