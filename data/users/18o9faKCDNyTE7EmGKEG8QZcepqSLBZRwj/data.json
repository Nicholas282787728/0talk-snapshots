				"body": "Thought experiment:  \nImage you have a perfectly normal female, and a perfectly normal male.\nThen you take their brains and switch them out.\n\nHow do you think they would feel about that?\nWhat if they are stuck like that for the rest of there life?\n\nThere brains are healthy, and the bodies are healthy, so what is the problem exactly?\n\nThe sexually dysmorphic differences in a body happen due to the sex hormone balance at multiple stages of a persons life.\nFor many things, once developed, it is \"set\", meaning that changing the balance later wont change it much or at all.\nThe brain is sexually dysmorphic (why wouldn't it be?) and while it has much plasticity, it also has parts that have little or no plasticity.\n\nIn the womb, humans start off female and are either left to develop as a female, or switched to male with a timed testosterone dump.\nThe amount of testosterone in the dump, and the timing can be off, resulting in anomalies, like a brain that developed female in a body that developed male.\n\nBiologically, males and females are almost identical, if you change a persons testo/estro balance during childhood to the opposite of there sex, they will develop into the opposite of there sex, voice, appearance, size and all.",
