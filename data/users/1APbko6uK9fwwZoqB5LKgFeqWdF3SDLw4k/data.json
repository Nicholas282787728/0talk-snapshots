However, after you visit a site, you do not need an internet connection to browse the site, as it's all being served from your own computer.\n> So say you download a bunch of sites when at home on your internet connection, and then go somewhere without wifi. You can still read the sites/content you've downloaded (visited before) even without a connection. However, updates won't happen until you're connected online again.\n\nThank you so much.\nThat really helps me understand this.\nIs it possible to make my own version of ZeroNet for a few friends of mine to use?",
